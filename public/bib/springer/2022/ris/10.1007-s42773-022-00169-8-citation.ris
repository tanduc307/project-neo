AB  - As a carbon-rich material produced by pyrolysis of biomass, biochar features low cost, large specific surface area, and widely available feedstocks based on the functional diversity and environmental-friendly properties, it has received increasing attention in the fields of pollutant removal due to three winâ€“win effects of water remediation, carbon sequestration and reutilization of wastes. To design excellent biochar-based catalysts for environmental applications, one must understand recent advances in the catalysts for contaminant removal. This review focuses on the current application of biochar-based catalysts in redox systems, Fenton-like systems, sonocatalytic systems and photocatalytic systems. Besides in-depth discussion in effects of preparation conditions on physicochemical characteristics of biochars, the review supplements new preparation technologies of biochar and biochar-based catalysts. Most importantly, the advantages/shortcomings, catalysis mechanisms, as well as the pollutant removal ability of  different types of biochar-based catalysts are discussed. The environmental risks of the catalyst applications are also elaborated on. Future research on biochar-based catalyst production and its environmental applications is discussed. The review provides a good overview of the current advances of biochar-based catalysts in pollutant control and the futureresearch directions.

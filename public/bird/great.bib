abstract = {Biochar can be an effective carrier for microbial inoculants because of its favourable properties promoting microbial life. In this review, we assess the effectiveness of biochar as a microbial carrier for agricultural and environmental applications. Biochar is enriched with organic carbon, contains nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium as nutrients, and has a high porosity and moisture-holding capacity. The large number of active hydroxyl, carboxyl, sulfonic acid group, amino, imino, and acylamino hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups are effective for microbial cell adhesion and proliferation. The use of biochar as a carrier of microbial inoculum has been shown to enhance the persistence, survival and colonization of inoculated microbes in soil and plant roots, which play a crucial role in soil biochemical processes, nutrient and carbon cycling, and soil contamination remediation. Moreover, biochar-based microbial inoculants including probiotics effectively promote plant growth and remediate soil contaminated with organic pollutants. These findings suggest that biochar can serve as a promising substitute for non-renewable substrates, such as peat, to formulate and deliver microbial inoculants. The future research directions in relation to improving the carrier material performance and expanding the potential applications of this emerging biochar-based microbial immobilization technology have been proposed.}

abstract = {Biochar, a carbonaceous material with engineering potential, has gained attention as an efficient catalyst in persulfate-based advanced oxidation processes (PS-AOPs). Although biomass feedstocks are known as a critical factor for the performance of biochar, the relationship between the catalytic efficiency/mechanism and the types of biomass feedstocks is still unclear. Thus, according to recent advances in experimental and theoretical researches, this paper provides a systematic review of the properties of biochar, and the relationship between catalytic performance in PS-AOPs and biomass feedstocks, where the differences in physicochemical properties (surface properties, pore structure, etc.) and activation path of different sourced biochars, are introduced. In addition, how the tailoring of biochar (such as heteroatomic doping and co-pyrolysis of biomass) affects its activation efficiency and mechanism in PS-AOPs is summarized. Finally, the suitable application scenarios or systems of different sourced biochars, appropriate methods to improve the catalytic performance of different types of biochar and the prospects and challenges for the development of biochar in PS-AOPs are proposed.}

abstract = {Environmental issues caused by food waste are important concerns for human well-being and ecosystem health. Valorization of food waste into energy and carbon materials has been extensively investigated. Here, we reviewed the most recent advancements in the thermochemical conversion of food waste into engineered biochar. Synthesis routes and practical applications of the food waste-derived biochar was succinctly reviewed. Engineered biochar is a promising alternative for mitigating environmental pollution and alleviating energy crisis. The underlying relationships between engineered biochar properties and specific applications are still unclear, therefore, machine learning-aided engineered biochar design and process optimization was proposed. Moreover, before any industrial scale implementation, detailed assessments of the environmental benefits and economic feasibility must be conducted. In the context of carbon neutrality, thermochemical upcycling of food waste into engineered biochar for energy and environmental applications can significantly contribute to attaining sustainable food waste management, mitigating environmental pollution, and addressing the energy shortage crisis, and thus will eventually facilitate the fulfillment of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Furthermore, the existing challenges in the practical valorization of food waste into engineered biochar are comprehensively discussed, and outlooks are proposed.}

abstract = {The replacement of inert gas by CO2 in pyrolysis has piqued a great deal of interest in recent years due to its numerous positive effects on end products. The reactive nature of CO2 at higher pyrolysis temperatures (above 700 °C) during pyrolysis improves pyrolytic gas production (H2, CO, and CH4) by increasing thermal cracking of tar, inhibiting secondary char formation, and enhancing char gasification, thereby reducing char yield. The existing review articles focus on the impact of CO2 on tar and gaseous products during pyrolysis, with little information on its impact on biochar production and properties via slow pyrolysis of various organic wastes. Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate the effect of CO2 on biochar production during slow pyrolysis for industrial purposes, because CO2 from flue gas can be used as the pyrolysis gas environment, which can ultimately improve biochar production in terms of economic viability, environmental impact, and modified properties. The goal of this review is to conduct a thorough investigation of the effect of CO2 atmosphere on slow pyrolysis performance (400–700 °C), with a particular emphasis on biochar yield and properties for environmental and agricultural applications in comparison to inert atmosphere by highlighting the existing challenges and future opportunities.}

The current large scale computation frameworks are based on a scaling-out approach for distributing tasks over a cluster of commodity machines. Apache Spark is one of these frameworks that has excelled in many computational tasks. Implementation of statistical learning algorithms over Spark is a challenging task. A bad implementation may lead to a significant decrease in performance and a waste of cluster time and money. Poor performance is mostly due to a lack of understanding of the data in hand and Spark's underlying mechanisms more than it is due to a deficit in the framework itself. In this paper, we consider the use case of X2 feature selection which is very popular in supervised learning pipelines. Our implementation follows the algorithm of the Scikit-learn Python machine learning library which is different than the algorithm used by the Spark machine learning library. The Spark ML library implementation of X2 feature selection accepts only categorical features. Our alternative implementation is more suitable for numerical features. We experiment in particular with features of high sparsity such as n-gram counts. We study the best partitioning scheme of the data and the optimal number of partitions. Our experiments are run over the Databricks platform.},

Our forecasting technique is the chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID), which is a machine learning approach that adopts decision tree as a main data structure for building a model and applies a chi-square computation for node splitting. The CHAID algorithm is in a group of multivariate data analysis in that it takes more than one attributes to build a model. The input data used in our model building phase are from the remote sensing indices, oceanic sensors, and ground sources. Remote sensing index data are obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States. These indices are used as representatives to assess temperature, humidity and brightness in the atmosphere as well as the greenness conditions of plants over the specific Earth surface areas. The oceanic sensor data are ONI index computed by NOAA to announce El Nino or La Nina events, which are assumed to affect the growth rate of mosquito larva. From the model assessment, we found that the multivariate CHAID models in both provinces are more accurate than the univariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models that are currently used by the Thai public health practitioners. We also compare predictive performance of CHAID models against ARIMA and those obtained from other machine learning techniques. The CHAID models outperform the others. The induced CHAID model is thus considered efficient enough to be applied for predicting number of dengue infected patients.},

Then they are converted from non linear space into linear space using Chi-squared kernel. The result is fed into One-vs-All SVM classifier to build signs models. Training and test stages of this technique are implemented on hand postures images using cluttered backgrounds for different lighting conditions, scales and rotations. This technique of computing new hand features and modified classifier has a satisfactory recognition rate and can achieve good real-time performance regardless of the image resolution. As an application, it can be implemented on embedded system for real-time Human-Machine or Human-Human communication system.},

  abstract  = {We present a novel chi-squared progressive photon mapping algorithm (CPPM) that constructs an estimator by controlling the bandwidth to obtain superior image quality. Our estimator has parametric statistical advantages over prior nonparametric methods. First, we show that when a probability density function of the photon distribution is subject to uniform distribution, the radiance estimation is unbiased under certain assumptions. Next, the local photon distribution is evaluated via a chi-squared test to determine whether the photons follow the hypothesized distribution (uniform distribution) or not. If the statistical test deems that the photons inside the bandwidth are uniformly distributed, bandwidth reduction should be suspended. Finally, we present a pipeline with a bandwidth retention and conditional reduction scheme according to the test results. This pipeline not only accumulates sufficient photons for a reliable chi-squared test, but also guarantees that the estimate converges to the correct solution under our assumptions. We evaluate our method on various benchmarks and observe significant improvement in the running time and rendering quality in terms of mean squared error over prior progressive photon mapping methods.},

Although the field is well studied for deterministic graphs, in many situations, the graphs are probabilistic in nature. In this paper, we address the problem of subgraph querying in large probabilistic labeled graphs. We employ a novel algorithmic framework, called ChiSeL, that uses the idea of statistical significance for approximate subgraph matching on uncertain graphs that have uncertainty in edges. For each candidate matching vertex in the target graph that matches a query vertex, we compute its statistical significance using the chi-squared statistic. The search algorithm then proceeds in a greedy manner by exploring the vertex neighbors having the largest chi-square score. In addition to edge uncertainty, we also show how ChiSeL can handle uncertainty in labels and/or vertices. Experiments on large real-life graphs show the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm.},

Since the chi-square test is one of the most well known and commonly used tests in statistics, it is surprising that there has been no prior work on designing streaming algorithms for it. The test is not based on a specific distribution assumption and has one-sample and two-sample variants. Given a stream of data, the one-sample variant tests if the stream is drawn from a fixed distribution. The two-sample variant tests if two data streams are drawn from the same or similar distributions. One major advantage of using statistical tests over other quantities commonly measured by streaming algorithms is that these tests do not require parameter tuning and have results that can be easily interpreted by data analysts. The problem that we solve in this paper is how to compute the chi-square test on streams with minimal parameter configuration and assumptions. We give rigorous proofs showing that it is possible to compute the chi-square statistic with high fidelity and an almost quadratic reduction in memory in the continuous case, but the categorical case only admits heuristic solutions. We validate the performance and accuracy of our algorithms through extensive testing on both real and synthetic data sets.},

The classification speed is slow and the computational complexity is high. The distance between the test sample and all the training samples needs to be calculated to determine the k nearest neighbors. Therefore, this paper proposes a fuzzy k nearest neighbor (FKNN) algorithm based on weighted chi-square distance. First, the fuzzy normalization process is performed, and the similarity is taken as the fuzzy membership degree. The closeness of features is used to determine the weight of each feature, and the weighted chi-square distance is used as the distance measure. Finally, the sample class to be classified is determined by the class membership of k neighbors.

  abstract  = {Active learning is to select the most informative examples to request their labels. Most previous studies in active learning for multi-label classification didn't pay enough attention on label correlations. This leads to a bad performance for classification. In this paper, we proposed a chi-square statistics multi-label active learning (CSMAL) algorithm, which uses chi-square statistics to accurately evaluate correlations between labels. CSMAL considers not only positive relationships but also negative ones. It uses the average correlation between a potential label and its rest unlabeled labels as the label information for each sample-label pair. CSMAL further integrates uncertainty and label information to select example-label pairs to request labels. Our empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method CSMAL outperforms the state-of-the-art active learning methods for multi-label classification. It significantly reduces the labeling workloads and improves the performance of a classifier built.},

Many cities are often shrouded in a pollution haze, which threatens seriously the health of the people. Therefore, it is very necessary to establish a scientific and effective air quality forecast model. In this paper, an AQI level forecasting model using chi-square test and BP neural network is established. The model is based on the monitoring data of air pollution obtained from Shijiazhuang air quality monitoring stations. Firstly the model uses chi-square test method to determine the influence factors. Secondly it uses these influence factors data to train the neural network. Finally, the test of the forecasting model is evaluated. The results show that: The AQI level forecasting model has higher forecasting accuracy, it improves the effectiveness and practicability, and can provide more reliable decision evidence for environmental protection departments.},

  abstract  = {Labeled graphs provide a natural way of representing entities, relationships and structures within real datasets such as knowledge graphs and protein interactions. Applications such as question answering, semantic search, and motif discovery entail efficient approaches for subgraph matching involving both label and structural similarities. Given the NP-completeness of subgraph isomorphism and the presence of noise, approximate graph matching techniques are required to handle queries in a robust and real-time manner. This paper presents a novel technique to characterize the subgraph similarity based on statistical significance captured by chi-square statistic. The statistical significance model takes into account the background structure and label distribution in the neighborhood of vertices to obtain the best matching subgraph and, therefore, robustly handles partial label and structural mismatches. Based on the model, we propose two algorithms, VELSET and NAGA, that, given a query graph, return the top-k most similar subgraphs from a (large) database graph. While VELSET is more accurate and robust to noise, NAGA is faster and more applicable for scenarios with low label noise. Experiments on large real-life graph datasets depict significant improvements in terms of accuracy and running time in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract  = {The problem of identification of statistically significant patterns in a sequence of data has been applied to many domains such as intrusion detection systems, financial models, web-click records, automated monitoring systems, computational biology, cryptology, and text analysis. An observed pattern of events is deemed to be statistically significant if it is unlikely to have occurred due to randomness or chance alone. We use the chi-square statistic as a quantitative measure of statistical significance. Given a string of characters generated from a memoryless Bernoulli model, the problem is to identify the substring for which the empirical distribution of single letters deviates the most from the distribution expected from the generative Bernoulli model. This deviation is captured using the chi-square measure. The most significant substring (MSS) of a string is thus defined as the substring having the highest chi-square value. Till date, to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist any algorithm to find the MSS in better than O(n2) time, where n denotes the length of the string. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to find the most significant substring, whose running time is O(n3/2) with high probability. We also study some variants of this problem such as finding the top-t set, finding all substrings having chi-square greater than a fixed threshold and finding the MSS among substrings greater than a given length. We experimentally demonstrate the asymptotic behavior of the MSS on varying the string size and alphabet size. We also describe some applications of our algorithm on cryptology and real world data from finance and sports. Finally, we compare our technique with the existing heuristics for finding the MSS.},

  abstract      = {An ordinary character $\chi $ of a finite group is called orthogonally stable, if all non-degenerate invariant quadratic forms on any module affording the character $\chi $ have the same discriminant. This is the orthogonal discriminant, $\disc(\chi )$, of $\chi $, a square class of the character field. Based on experimental evidence we conjecture that the orthogonal discriminant is always an odd square class in the sense of Definition 1.4. This note proves this conjecture for finite solvable groups. For $p$-group there is an explicit formula for $\disc(\chi )$ that reads $\disc(\chi ) = (-p)^{\chi(1)/2}$ if $p\equiv 3 \pmod{4}$ and $\disc (\chi ) = (-1)^{\chi(1)/2}$ for $p=2$.},

  abstract      = {Reduced chi-squared is a very popular method for model assessment, model comparison, convergence diagnostic, and error estimation in astronomy. In this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can only be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for differentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation procedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used with due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also applicable to nonlinear models.},

I demonstrate that these statistics should not be used to determine the goodness-of-fit with data values of 10 or less. I modify the chi-square-gamma statistic for the purpose of improving its goodness-of-fit performance. I demonstrate that the modified chi-square-gamma statistic performs (nearly) like an ideal chi-square statistic for the determination of goodness-of-fit with low-count data. On average, for correct (true) models, the mean value of modified chi-square-gamma statistic is equal to the number of degrees of freedom (nu) and its variance is 2*nu --- like the chi-square distribution for nu degrees of freedom. Probabilities for modified chi-square-gamma goodness-of-fit values can be calculated with the incomplete gamma function. I give a practical demonstration showing how the modified chi-square-gamma statistic can be used in experimental astrophysics by analyzing simulated X-ray observations of a weak point source (signal-to-noise ratio of 5.2; 40 photons spread over 317 pixels) on a noisy background (0.06 photons per pixel). Accurate estimates (95% confidence intervals/limits) of the location and intensity of the X-ray point source are determined.},

Asymptotically both are chi square distributed so an obvious question is which of the two statistics that has a distribution that is closest to the chi square distribution. Surprisingly, when there is only one degree of freedom it seems like the distribution of information divergence is much better approximated by a chi square distribution than the chi square statistic. For random variables we introduce a new transformation that transform several important distributions into new random variables that are almost Gaussian. For the binomial distributions and the Poisson distributions we formulate a general conjecture about how close their transform are to the Gaussian. The conjecture is proved for Poisson distributions.},

  abstract      = {A model-based windowed chi-squared procedure is proposed for identifying falsified sensor measurements. We employ the widely-used static chi-squared and the dynamic cumulative sum (CUSUM) fault/attack detection procedures as benchmarks to compare the performance of the windowed chi-squared detector. In particular, we characterize the state degradation that a class of attacks can induce to the system while enforcing that the detectors do not raise alarms (zero-alarm attacks). We quantify the advantage of using dynamic detectors (windowed chi-squared and CUSUM detectors), which leverages the history of the state, over a static detector (chi-squared) which uses a single measurement at a time. Simulations using a chemical reactor are presented to illustrate the performance of our tools.},

Through analytical derivations and toy model simulations, we show that $\chi^2_\mathrm{CNP}$ leads to a significantly smaller bias on the best-fit model parameters compared to those using either Neyman's or Pearson's chi-square. When the computational cost of using the Poisson-likelihood chi-square is high, $\chi^2_\mathrm{CNP}$ provides a good alternative given its natural connection to the covariance matrix formalism.},

  abstract      = {Chi-squared random fields arise naturally from the study of fluctuations in field theories with SO(n) symmetry. The extrema of chi-squared fields are of particular physical interest. In this paper, we undertake a statistical analysis of the stationary points of chi-squared fields, with particular emphasis on extrema. We begin by describing the neighborhood of a stationary point in terms of a biased chi-squared random field, and then compute the expected profile of this field, as well as a variety of associated statistics. We are interested in understanding how spherically symmetric the neighborhood of a stationary point is, on average. To this end, we decompose the biased field into its spherical harmonic modes about this point, and explore their statistics. Using these mode statistics, we construct a metric to gauge the degree of spherical symmetry of the field in this neighborhood. Finally, we show how to leverage the harmonic decomposition to efficiently sample both Gaussian and chi-squared fields about a stationary point.},

  abstract      = {Softmax working with cross-entropy is widely used in classification, which evaluates the similarity between two discrete distribution columns (predictions and true labels). Inspired by chi-square test, we designed a new loss function called chi-square loss, which is also works for Softmax. Chi-square loss has a statistical background. We proved that it is unbiased in optimization, and clarified its using conditions (its formula determines that it must work with label smoothing). In addition, we studied the sample distribution of this loss function by visualization and found that the distribution is related to the neural network structure, which is distinct compared to cross-entropy. In the past, the influence of structure was often ignored when visualizing. Chi-square loss can notice changes in neural network structure because it is very strict, and we explained the reason for this strictness. We also studied the influence of label smoothing and discussed the relationship between label smoothing and training accuracy and stability. Since the chi-square loss is very strict, the performance will degrade when dealing samples of very many classes.},

  abstract      = {The ILL experiment, one of the "reactor anomaly" experiments, is re-examined. ILL's baseline of 8.78 m is the shortest of the short baseline experiments, and it is the experiment that finds the largest fraction of the electron anti-neutrinos disappearing -- over 20%. Previous analyses, if they do not ignore the ILL experiment, use functional forms for chisquare which are either totally new and unjustified, are the magnitude chi-square (also termed a "rate analysis"), or utilize a spectral form for chi-square which double counts the systematic error. We do an analysis which utilizes the standard, conventional form for chi-square as well as a derived form for a spectral chi-square. Results for the ILL, Huber, and Daya Bay fluxes are given. We find that the implications of the ILL experiment in providing evidence for a sterile, fourth neutrino are significantly enhanced. Moreover, we find that the ILL experiment provides a set of choices for specific values of the mass squared difference. The value of the mass square difference for the deepest minimum and its statistical significance, using the flux independent spectral chi-square and the Huber or Daya Bay flux are 0.92 eV$^2$ and 2.9 $\sigma$; for the conventional chi-square and the Daya Bay flux are 0.95 eV$^2$ and 3.0 $\sigma$; and for the conventional chi-square and Huber flux are 0.90 eV$^2$ and 3.3 $\sigma$. These probabilities are significantly larger than the 1.8 $\sigma$ found for the ILL experiment using a rate analysis.},

	abstract = {The exploitation of symbiotic interactions between species-specific algae-bacteria consortia is a viable strategy to improve wastewater remediation efficiency. In this work, specific interactions between Chlorella protothecoides and Brevundimonas diminuta were exploited to improve nutrient removal. The beneficial effects of the presence of B. diminuta were studied in continuous reactors, in comparison with co-cultivation of C. protothecoides with complex bacterial communities from activated sludge in artificial wastewater. The presence of B. diminuta increased the microalgal growth rate up to 5 times, depending on the environmental conditions, leading to a selective advantage when cultivated in continuous system. This decreased the washout point of microalgae at lower residence times. The proposed bioaugmentation approach was promising for a simultaneous removal of COD, N and P, up to about 92, 80 and 71\%, respectively. Finally, the applicability of such a consortium in real urban wastewater was successfully investigated in continuous reactor at several residence times.},

	abstract = {Heavy metal contamination of crop lands surrounding mines in North Vietnam is a major environmental issue for both farmers and the population as a whole. Technology for the production of biochar at a village and household level has been successfully introduced into Vietnamese villages. This study was undertaken to determine if rice straw biochar produced in simple drum ovens could remediate contaminated land. Tests were also carried out to determine if biochar and apatite mixed together could be more effective than biochar alone. Incubation trials were carried out over 90 days in pots to determine the total changes in exchangeable Cd, Pb and Zn. Detailed tests were carried out to determine the mechanisms that bound the heavy metals to the biochar. It was found that biochar at 5\% (BC5) and the mixture of biochar and apatite at 3\% (BCA3) resulted in the greatest reduction of exchangeable forms of Cd, Pb and Zn. The increase in soil pH caused by adding biochar and apatite created more negative charge on the soil surface that promoted Pb, Zn and Cd adsorption. Heavy metals were mainly bound in the organic, Fe/Mn and carbonate fractions of the biochar and the mixture of biochar and apatite by either ion exchange, adsorption, dissolution/precipitation and through substitution of cations in large organic molecules.},

	abstract = {Synthetic organophosphorus compounds are used as pesticides, plasticizers, air fuel ingredients and chemical warfare agents. Organophosphorus compounds are the most widely used insecticides, accounting for an estimated 34\% of world-wide insecticide sales. Contamination of soil from pesticides as a result of their bulk handling at the farmyard or following application in the field or accidental release may lead occasionally to contamination of surface and ground water. Several reports suggest that a wide range of water and terrestrial ecosystems may be contaminated with organophosphorus compounds. These compounds possess high mammalian toxicity and it is therefore essential to remove them from the environments. In addition, about 200 000 metric tons of nerve (chemical warfare) agents have to be destroyed world-wide under Chemical Weapons Convention (1993). Bioremediation can offer an efficient and cheap option for decontamination of polluted ecosystems and destruction of nerve agents. The first micro-organism that could degrade organophosphorus compounds was isolated in 1973 and identified as Flavobacterium sp. Since then several bacterial and a few fungal species have been isolated which can degrade a wide range of organophosphorus compounds in liquid cultures and soil systems. The biochemistry of organophosphorus compound degradation by most of the bacteria seems to be identical, in which a structurally similar enzyme called organophosphate hydrolase or phosphotriesterase catalyzes the first step of the degradation. organophosphate hydrolase encoding gene opd (organophosphate degrading) gene has been isolated from geographically different regions and taxonomically different species. This gene has been sequenced, cloned in different organisms, and altered for better activity and stability. Recently, genes with similar function but different sequences have also been isolated and characterized. Engineered microorganisms have been tested for their ability to degrade different organophosphorus pollutants, including nerve agents. In this article, we review and propose pathways for degradation of some organophosphorus compounds by microorganisms. Isolation, characterization, utilization and manipulation of the major detoxifying enzymes and the molecular basis of degradation are discussed. The major achievements and technological advancements towards bioremediation of organophosphorus compounds, limitations of available technologies and future challenge are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Pesticides have become an inevitable part of the modern environment as they are widely used in agriculture, household, and public health sectors and, hence, are extensively distributed throughout most ecosystems. Currently, organophosphate pesticides are the most commercially favored group of pesticides, with large application areas all over the world. Depending on their fate, these organophosphorus compounds may become bioavailable for microbial degradation. Environmental microbes, such as Aspergillus, Pseudomonas, Chlorella, and Arthrobacter, are capable of coupling a variety of physical and biochemical mechanisms for the degradation of organophosphate pesticides, including adsorption, hydrolysis of P–O alkyl and aryl bonds, photodegradation, and enzymatic mineralization. Enzymes, such as esterase, diisopropyl fluorophosphatase, phosphotriesterase, somanase, parathion hydrolase, and paraoxonase, have been isolated from microbes to study and understand the catabolic pathways involved in the biotransformation of these xenobiotic compounds. This review highlights various aspects of biodegradation of organophosphate pesticides along with biological and molecular characterization of some organophosphate pesticide-degrading bacteria.},

	abstract = {Eighteen severe or fatal reactions induced by bacterially contaminated blood or blood products are recorded. Thirteen cultures from the implicated or an associated product were studied. Eight were of Pseudomonas, none of which were P. aeruginosa, 2, Paracolobactrum aerogenoides, and 3, Escherichia freundii.
Eighty-five other cultures isolated from blood products, but not associated with reactions, were also studied. From both plasma and albumin, micrococci predominated; other cultures were gram-negative rods, sporeformers, and diphtheroids. Streptococci came only from plasma. The relative distribution of the cultures from plasma was similar to that reported for cultures isolated from blood. The micrococci from plasma represented a number of species, from albumin they comprised a greater percentage of the total but fewer species were represented.
The growth temperature range of all strains associated with reactions and of representative ones from plasma and albumin was determined. All strains associated with reactions and all other gram-negative rods grew at blood-storage temperatures. All pseudomonads grew at the lowest temperatures, some did not grow at 37 °C., the others very poorly. The temperature range for the gram-positive bacteria, as a whole, was higher. A few, however, grew at 10 °C., the upper limit for blood storage. The range in which all cultures grew readily was limited to above 25 °C. and below 30 °C.
The importance of nonpathogenic bacteria as the source of contamination of blood and blood products, the use of a proper temperature for the sterility test, and the correct identification of contaminants was discussed.},

	abstract = {Members of the genus Pseudomonas inhabit a wide variety of environments, which is reﬂected in their versatile metabolic capacity and broad potential for adaptation to ﬂuctuating environmental conditions. Here, we examine and compare the genomes of a range of Pseudomonas spp. encompassing plant, insect and human pathogens, and environmental saprophytes. In addition to a large number of allelic differences of common genes that confer regulatory and metabolic ﬂexibility, genome analysis suggests that many other factors contribute to the diversity and adaptability of Pseudomonas spp. Horizontal gene transfer has impacted the capability of pathogenic Pseudomonas spp. in terms of disease severity (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and speciﬁcity (Pseudomonas syringae). Genome rearrangements likely contribute to adaptation, and a considerable complement of unique genes undoubtedly contributes to strain- and species-speciﬁc activities by as yet unknown mechanisms. Because of the lack of conserved phenotypic differences, the classiﬁcation of the genus has long been contentious. DNA hybridization and genome-based analyses show close relationships among members of P. aeruginosa, but that isolates within the Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens and P. syringae species are less closely related and may constitute different species. Collectively, genome sequences of Pseudomonas spp. have provided insights into pathogenesis and the genetic basis for diversity and adaptation.},

Isolation of Pseudomonas fluorescens isolates were carried out on King’s B medium. Twelve Pseudomonas fluorescens species were isolated from the Rhizosphere of Fabaceae family namely faba bean screened for the production of hydrogen cyanide. For the production of hydrogen cyanide, Pseudomonas fluorescens isolates were streaked into King’s B agar plates supplemented with glycine. Total of Pseudomonas fluorescens isolates had a potential to produce hydrogen cyanide. Therefore, these isolated can be used as a biological control against plant pathogen microbes.},

	abstract = {The widespread use of pesticides in modern agriculture is of increasing concern due to environmental contamination and subsequent biodiversity loss. Chlorpyrifos is a toxic organophosphate pesticide. Repeated applications of chlorpyrifos modify the soil microbial community structure and pose potential health risks to the other nontargets. Chlorpyrifos has been reported as the second most commonly detected pesticide in food and water. Extensive use of chlorpyrifos in agriculture and persistence in the environment have raised public concern and demand for safe technologies to overcome the pollution and toxicity problems. Here, we review pollution and toxicity issues associated with chlorpyrifos use and discuss strategies to solve pesticide contamination. Chlorpyrifos, previously shown to be resistant to enhanced degradation, has now been proved to undergo enhanced microbe-mediated decay. Here, special emphasis is given to degradation methods such as ozonation, Fenton treatment, photodegradation, and advanced oxidation processes along with microbial degradation. Finally, we focus on degradation process at enzyme and molecular levels which will enable us to elucidate the exact degradative pathway involved in biodegradation.},

The degradation half-live of chlorpyrifos at levels of 4, 8, and 12 mg/kg in soil were calculated to be 14.3, 16.7, and 18.0 d, respectively. The Biolog study showed that the average well color development (AWCD) in soils was signiﬁcantly (P {\textless} 0.05) inhibited by chlorpyrifos within the ﬁrst two weeks and thereafter recovered to a similar level as the control. A similar variation in the diversity indices (Simpson index 1/D and McIntosh index U) was observed, but no signiﬁcant diﬀerence among the values of the Shannon-Wiener index H was found in chlorpyrifos-treated soils. With an increasing chlorpyrifos concentration, the half-life of chlorpyrifos was signiﬁcantly (P 0.05) extended and its inhibitory eﬀect on soil microorganisms was aggravated. It is concluded that chlorpyrifos residues in soil had a temporary or short-term inhibitory eﬀect on soil microbial functional diversity.},

	abstract = {This book explores what games and play can tell us about contemporary processes of urbanization and examines how the dynamics of gaming can help us understand the interurban competition that underpins the entrepreneurialism of the smart and creative city. Game and Play in the Creative, Smart and Ecological City is a collection of chapters written by an interdisciplinary　group of scholars from game studies, media studies, play studies, architecture, landscape architecture and urban planning. It situates the historical evolution of play and games in the urban landscape and outlines the scope of the various ways games and play contribute to the city's economy, cultural life and environmental concerns. In connecting games and play more concretely to urban discourses and design strategies, this book urges scholars to consider their growing contribution to three overarching sets of discourses that dominate urban planning and policy today: the creative and cultural economies of cities; the smart and playable city; and ecological cities. This interdisciplinary work will be of great interest to students and scholars of game studies, play studies, landscape architecture (and allied design fields), urban geography, and art history.},

              rRNA-based studies, which have become the most common method for assessing microbial communities, rely upon faithful amplification of the corresponding genes from the original DNA sample. We report here an analysis and reevaluation of commonly used primers for amplifying the DNA between positions 27 and 1492 of bacterial 16S rRNA genes (numbered according to the
              Escherichia coli
              rRNA). We propose a formulation for a forward primer (27f) that includes three sequences not usually present. We compare our proposed formulation to two common alternatives by using linear amplification—providing an assessment that is independent of a reverse primer—and in combination with the 1492 reverse primer (1492r) under the PCR conditions appropriate for making community rRNA gene clone libraries. For analyses of DNA from human vaginal samples, our formulation was better at maintaining the original rRNA gene ratio of
              Lactobacillus
              spp. to
              Gardnerella
              spp., particularly under stringent amplification conditions. Because our 27f formulation remains relatively simple, having seven distinct primer sequences, there is minimal loss of overall amplification efficiency and specificity.},

The species of Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter were traced to be behind nitrosification and nitrification in this heavily fertilized soil zone. These soils have shown higher nitrification potentials due to the presence of nitrifying bacteria. These bacteria were enriched in liquid broths and characterised morphologically and biochemically for confirmation. The related details are discussed herewith.},

The removal of ammoniacal nitrogen in filters containing different sizes of Lytag medium and operated for combined carbonaceous treatment and nitrification, was compared at different hydraulic and volumetric loading rates. The results suggest that filters containing the smallest media size ( 2 4 mm), gave optimum nitrification at ammoniacalnitrogen loading rates up to 0.6 kg/m3. d. At higher loading rates there was a rapid decrease in nitrification for this size of medium but, with 2.8-5.6 mm medium, nitrification continued at loading rates up to 1 kg amm. N/m3 d. The filters containing larger media sizes (4-8 mm and 5 . 6 11.2 mm) exhibited low levels of nitrification above a loading rate of 0.2-0.4 kg amm. N/m3. d.},

Media characteristics also affect day to day running costs such as those involved in backwashing. To allow an informed choice relating to filter media and their prospective uses a number of standards have been produced, most recently the British Effluent and Water Association (BEWA) standard. The aim of this study was to investigate a number of granular media using the BEWA standard in order to determine their suitability for BAFs. All the media samples investigated appear suitable for use as BAF media with one in particular having all the necessary characteristics e.g. low density, high specific surface area and resistance to attrition.

The medium for the anaerobic and anoxic zones was 10 mm diameter sand while the medium for the oxic zone was 5 mm diameter sand. The inﬂuent sCOD and total nitrogen concentrations in the feedwater were approximately 250 mg/L and 35 mg N/L, respectively. sCOD removal at optimum hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3 h with recirculation rates of 100, 200 and 300\% in the column was above 96\%. Nitriﬁcation was found to be more than 96\% for 3 h HRT at 200 and 300\% recirculation. Total nitrogen removal was consistent at more than 80\% for 4 and 6 h HRT at 300\% recirculation. For 3 h HRT and 300\% recirculation, total nitrogen removal was approximately 79\%. The ammonia loading rates for maximum ammonia removed were 0.15 and 0.19 kg NH3-N/m3-day for 100 and 200\% recirculation, respectively. The experimental results demonstrated that the BAF can be operated at an HRT of 3 h with 200 –300\% recirculation rates with more than 96\% removal of sCOD and ammonia and at least 75\% removal of total nitrogen.},

Study of belowground competition, unlike aboveground shoot competition, is hampered by our inability to observe roots. We developed a consumer-resource model based in game theory that predicts the root density spatial distribution of individual plants and tested the model predictions in a greenhouse experiment. Plants in the experiment reacted to neighbors as predicted by the model’s evolutionary stable equilibrium, by both overinvesting in nearby roots and reducing their root foraging range. We thereby provide a theoretical foundation for belowground allocation of carbon by vegetation that reconciles seemingly contradictory experimental results such as root segregation and the tragedy of the commons in plant roots.},

	abstract = {Climate change has been threatening the sustainable development of the agricultural sector around the globe. It is a main reason of prolonged drought which gives negative effects on productivity and quality of agricultural products. For solving these emerging challenges, there have been many solutions on improving soil health in order to increase the tolerance of soil and plant to adverse weather conditions. Recent researches on biochar show that this is a good soil amendment because of its water holding capacity, nutrient retention, increased porosity and enhanced soil microbial activity. This study investigated the effect of biochar from rice husk and coffee husk produced by gasifier on the ability to retain water and moisture in basalt and grey soil, which collected from farming areas in Vietnam. The result illustrates that water holding capacity and soil moisture depend significantly on each type of biochar and applied dosage as well as characteristic of soil. Accordingly, when adding 1\% biochar by mass to the grey soil (initial moisture content of 13\%) helped increase the efficiency of water holding capacity by 26-33\% corresponding to coffee husk or rice husk biochar. It is different from basalt soil (initial moisture content of 27\%) when adding 1\% rice husk biochar will impact on water retention efficiency was 7\%, equivalent to 3\% biochar from coffee husk. Therefore, biochar can be introduced as a soil conditioner effectively in dry soil or enhance the water retention in fertile soil that eventually contributed to the sustainable agriculture.},

	abstract = {Pyrethroid insecticides have been used for more than 40 years and account for 25\% of the worldwide insecticide market. Although their acute neurotoxicity to adults has been well characterized, information regarding the potential developmental neurotoxicity of this class of compounds is limited. There is a large age dependence to the acute toxicity of pyrethroids in which neonatal rats are at least an order of magnitude more sensitive than adults to two pyrethroids. There is no information on age-dependent toxicity for most pyrethroids. In the present review we examine the scientific data related to potential for age-dependent and developmental neurotoxicity of pyrethroids. As a basis for understanding this neurotoxicity, we discuss the heterogeneity and ontogeny of voltage-sensitive sodium channels, a primary neuronal target of pyrethroids. We also summarize 22 studies of the developmental neurotoxicity of pyrethroids and review the strengths and limitations of these studies. These studies examined numerous end points, with changes in motor activity and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor density the most common. Many of the developmental neurotoxicity studies suffer from inadequate study design, problematic statistical analyses, use of formulated products, and/or inadequate controls. These factors confound interpretation of results. To better understand the potential for developmental exposure to pyrethroids to cause neurotoxicity, additional, well-designed and well-executed developmental neurotoxicity studies are needed. These studies should employ state-of-the-science methods to promote a greater understanding of the mode of action of pyrethroids in the developing nervous system.},

	abstract = {Introduction Most aquatic invertebrates and fish are highly susceptible to synthetic pyrethroid insecticides (1, 2). All pyrethroids are potent neurotoxicants that interfere with nerve cell function by interacting with voltage-dependent sodium channels as well as other ion channels, resulting in repetitive firing of neurons and eventually causing paralysis (3, 4). Exposed organisms may exhibit symptoms of hyperexcitation, tremors, convulsions, followed by lethargy and paralysis. Pyrethroids occur mostly as mixtures of stereoisomeric forms, and the toxicity of individual isomers can vary (5). There are two groups of pyrethroids with distinctive poisoning symptoms, type I and type II. Type II pyrethroids are distinguished from type I pyrethroids by an alpha-cyano group in their structure. While type I pyrethroids (e.g. permethrin, cismethrin) exert their neurotoxicity primarily through interference with sodium channel function in the central nervous system, type II pyrethroids (e.g. deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, cypermethrin, bifenthrin) can affect additional ion-channel targets such as chloride},

	abstract = {Synthetic pyrethroids are pesticides derived from naturally occurring pyrethrins, taken from pyrethrum of dried Chrysanthemum flowers. They are chemically designed to be more toxic with lower break down times and are formulated with synergists increasing potency and compromising the body’s ability to detoxify the pesticide. Though claimed to be selectively toxic to insects, synthetic pyrethroids are extremely to xic to aquatic organisms, including fish in concentrations similar to those used for controlling mosquito, black fly and tsetse fly larvae, which are the actual targets of pyrethroids. Many pyrethroids have been linked to the disruption of the endocrine system, reproduction and sexual development, interference with the immune system and the induction of breast cancer. The widespread use of pyrethroids is a major problem as they pollute the agricultural lands and water resources and affect non-target organisms and humans. Recent studies show that some microbes are able to degrade synthetic pyrethroids by esterase production and this application is proposed as an inexpensive and simple method. In the present work, the aspects related to the toxicity and biodegradation of synthetic pyrethroids are discussed.},

It discusses the advantages of the gasiﬁcation technology over combustion, considers the size of the conversion plant in view of the local biomass availability, assesses the pros and cons of different gasiﬁer types in view of the application of the product gas. Subsequently the article focuses on the ﬂuidized bed technology to discuss the main process parameters and their inﬂuence on the product composition and the operability of the gasiﬁer. Finally a synthesis process (FT) is introduced shortly to illustrate the necessary gas cleaning steps in view of the purity requirements for the FT feed gas.},

	abstract = {Profenofos (PFF), an organophosphate (OP) insecticide, has been widely used for last two decades to control insect pests. Extensive use of this toxic pesticide is leading to serious environmental consequences which impose development of methods to reduce the environmental burden of PFF using an environmental friendly and cost effective approach. In this study, a PFF degrading bacterial consortium PBAC consisting of Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus sp. and Citrobacter koseri, was developed. Interestingly, compared to pure isolates, the consortium degraded PFF more efﬁciently. Following a 23 full factorial central composite design based on Response Surface Methodology (RSM), different culture conditions were optimized for PFF degradation. The optimal pH, temperature and inoculum size were found to be 6.83, 34.59  C ({\textasciitilde}35  C) and 0.59 g LÀ1 respectively to achieve maximal degradation of PFF (93.39\%). Analysis of the degradation products revealed that 4-bromo-2chlorophenol (BCP) was the major metabolite of PFF which was further metabolized to simpler products. Importantly, PBAC was capable of degrading a wide range of OP and other pesticides which renders it a useful tool for remediation of soil with a cocktail of contaminants.},

All pyrethroids were less toxic in muck soil as compared with Plainfield sand, and in air-dry (0.5\% water) as compared with moist (5\% water) Plainfield sand, with the effects being less on cypermethrin and fenvalerate and greater on permethrin and fenpropanate. None of the pyrethroids was affected by soil type and moisture to the same extent as was carbofuran. Permethrin, fenvalerate, and cypermethrin showed a negative temperature coefficient of toxicity in moist Plainfield sand, being from 1.4 to 1.9× more toxic at 15° than at 32°C. Fenpropanate, like carbofuran, was slightly more toxic at 32° than at 15°C. Generally, soil type, moisture, and temperature had minimal effects on the toxicity of the four pyrethroid insecticides. In persistence studies over 48 weeks, using Plainfield sand, the pyrethroids were more persistent than chlorpyrifos, but less persistent than dieldrin. Under these laboratory conditions, permethrin and fenvalerate were slightly more persistent, while fenpropanate and cypermethrin were as persistent as carbofuran.

            Résumé
            
              Dans des essais de toxicité par contact direct de 4 pyréthrinoïdes et 3 insecticides courants sur des grillons (
              Acheta pennsylvanicus
              (Burmeister)) âgés de 24–48 heures comme cobayes, le carbofuran s’est révélé le plus toxique, suivi dans l’ordre par la cyperméthrine, le fensulfothion, le chlorpyrifos, le fenvalérate, le fenpropanate et la perméthrine. Dans un sable Plainfield humide (5\% d’eau) et avec le même insecte d’essai, c’est le chlorpyrifos qui est le plus toxique, suivi par le carbofuran, le fenpropanate, la cyperméthrine, la perméthrine, le fenvalérate et le fensulfothion, ce qui montre que même si elles sont très fortement absorbées par le sol, les pyréthrinoïdes demeurent relativement actives comme insecticides du sol. Toutes les pyréthrinoïdes sont moins toxiques en terre organique qu’en sable Plainfield, et en sable sec (0,5\% d’eau) qu’humide (5\% d’eau), ces effets se faisant sentir moins sur la cyperméthrine et le fenvalérate et davantage sur la perméthrine et le fenpropanate. Aucune des pyréthrinoïdes n’a été aussi fortement altérée par le type de sol et sa teneur en eau que le carbofuran. La perméthrine, le fenvalérate et la cyperméthrine affichent un coefficient de toxicité négatif en fonction de la température dans un sable Plainfield humide, étant de 1,4 à 1,9 fois plus toxiques à 15 qu’à 32°C. Le fenpropanate, comme le carbofuran, s’avère un peu plus toxique à 32 qu’à 15°C. En général, le type de sol, sa teneur en eau et sa température ont des effets négligeables sur la toxicité des quatre pyréthrinoïdes. Des études de rémanence au moyen du sable Plainfield révèlent qu’au bout de 48 semaines, les pyréthrinoïdes sont plus rémanentes que le chlorpyrifos, mais moins que la dieldrine. Dans ces conditions de laboratoire, la perméthrine et le fenvalérate sont légèrement plus rémanents, alors que le fenpropanate et la cyperméthrine persistent autant que le carbofuran. Les isomères-
              trans
              de la perméthrine et de la cyperméthrine disparaissent plus rapidement dans le sable que les isomères-
              cis
              , et parmi les isomères-
              trans
              , les formes 1S régressent plus rapidement que les 1R, contrairement aux formes correspondantes des isomères-

Primary screening was done to test bacterial ability to growth and resistance to cypermethrin by using nutrient agar plates containing 500 mg L-1 cypermethrin as a sole source of carbon and energy, and incubation at 37 ºϹ for 72 hours. Secondary screening results showed that these two bacterial isolates have the ability to grow and resistance cypermethrin concentration till 3600 mg L-1 in solid MMSM. If we increase concentration above 3600 mg L-1 bacterial isolate can’t tolerate and grow in it. According to VITEK 2 compact results the dominate isolate in soil contaminated with cypermethrin was Pseudomonas aeruginosa about 87.5\%. The optimum conditions (pH, temperature and incubation period) for growth of two selected isolates and biodegradation of cypermethrin were examined. The results indicated that the best growth obtain at pH 7 under 30 ºC for 14 days. In lab experiment and under optimal conditions, cypermethrin biodegradation was measured by using FTIR and GC-MS analysis. The results shown that P. aeruginosa 1 was the best isolate for degrading cypermethrin with percentage 87.9\% while P. aeruginosa 2 with degrading percentage 80\%.},

Degradation was found to occur to a great extent only in the presence of Pseudomonas (IES-Ps-1) culture. Under aerobic conditions using mechanical aerators, Cypermethrin (20 mg/L) was almost completely degraded in just over 48 h at ambient temperature. Further loading of organic compound in subsequent experiments demonstrated that IES-PS-1was capable to degrade 82 \% Cypermethrin at 40 mg/L dose in approximately 48 h. When the concentration was increased to 80 mg/L, 50\% degradation of this compound was observed. Over this time period the cells could utilize only 17 \% of Cypermethrin when it was given 125 mg/L, respectively. These findings indicate that increased concentration of Cypermethrin has a marked effect on biodegradation performance of IES-Ps-1 with a modest increased in the duration of lag phase, but did not lead to complete inhibition or cell death. These results proved that IES-Ps-1 is responsible for Cypermethrin degradation. Such finding may be useful in designing a scale-up in situ or on-site hazardous waste bioremediation process for field application.},

Isolate W showed 96\% similarity to the 16S rRNA gene of a Pseudomonas putida unlike Y which showed 99\% similarity to the 16S rRNA gene of Burkholderia gladioli. Both strains grew well at pH 5.5–7.2 with a broad temperature proﬁle ranging from 28o to 36 oC. Bioremediation of profenofos-contaminated soil was examined using soil treated with 200 ug g-1; profenofos resulted in a higher degradation rate than control soils without inoculation. In a mineral salt medium (FTW) reduction in profenofos concentration was 90\% within 96 hours of incubation. A literature survey revealed that no data is available regarding the role of Burkholderia gladioli on pesticide biodegradation as well as on profenofos.},

              During colonization of the alfalfa rhizosphere,
              Pseudomonas fluorescens
              F113 undergoes phenotypic variation, resulting in the appearance of colonies with different morphology. Among phenotypic variants, three isolates, C, F, and S were selected, with the C variant showing colony morphology identical to that of the inoculated wild-type strain and F and S having a translucent and diffuse morphology. Phenotypic variants F and S were shown to preferentially colonize distal parts of the roots and showed alterations in motility, swimming faster than the C variant and swarming under conditions that did not allow swarming of the C variant. The motility behavior correlated with overproduction of the
              fliC-
              encoded protein flagellin but not with hyperflagellation. Flagella of the F and S variants were several times longer than those of the C variant, and overproduction of flagellin was regulated at the transcriptional level. Variant F showed alterations in traits that have been shown to be important for rhizosphere colonization, such as siderophore, cyanide, and exoprotease production, and these phenotypes were complemented by a cloned
              gacA
              . Sequence analysis of the
              gacA
              alelle in variant F suggested selection of the phenotype in the rhizosphere. Variant F was also affected in other phenotypes, such as lipopolysaccharide structure and flocculation in unshaken liquid medium, which were not complemented by the
              gacA
              or
              gacS
              gene. Mutation of the F113
              sss
              gene, encoding a site-specific recombinase, showed that most of the phenotypic variation was due to the activity of this recombinase, indicating that phase variation occurs during rhizosphere colonization.},

The molecular mass of the enzyme was determined to be 53 kDa. The optimum temperature for the activity was surprisingly 60 °C, and moreover, the puriﬁed enzyme showed a good pH stability, maintaining over 85\% of its initial activity in the pH 5.0−9.0 range. Most of the common metal ions exhibited little inﬂuence on the activity except for Hg2+, Ag+, and Cu2+. After the complete gene sequence of the degrading enzyme was obtained by subcloning, sequence analyses as well as enzymatic properties demonstrated that the islolated enzyme should be an aminopeptidase. This is the ﬁrst reported aminopeptidase for pyrethroid hydrolase, providing new potential enzyme resources for the degradation of this type of pesticide.},

	abstract = {The biodegradation of profenofos, an organophosphorus insecticide, by four Bacillus subtilis strains, namely, DR39, CS-126, TL-171, and TS-204, isolated from grapevines or grape rhizosphere was studied in liquid culture, on grape berries, and in vineyard soil. Each of the four B. subtilis strains enhanced the degradation of profenofos in all three matrices. Degradation rate constants were best obtained by ﬁrst + ﬁrst-order kinetics module. In nutrient broth spiked with 5 μg/mL profenofos, inoculation with B. subtilis strains DR-39, CS-126, TL-171, and TS-204 reduced the half-life (DT50) of profenofos to 4.03, 3.57, 2.87, and 2.53 days, respectively, from the DT50 = 12.90 days observed in the uninoculated control. In Thompson Seedless grapes sprayed with profenofos at a ﬁeld dose of 1250 mL ai/ha, the DT50 values were 1.07, 1.00, 2.13, and 2.20 days in grapes inoculated with B. subtilis strains DR-39, CS-126, TL-171, and TS-204, respectively, as compared to 2.20 days in uninoculated grapes. These four B. subtilis strains also enhanced the degradation of profenofos in autoclaved soil (DT50 = 5.93, 7.47, 6.00, and 4.37 days) and in nonautoclaved soil (DT50 = 0.87, 2.00, 2.07, and 2.43 days) amended with 5 μg/g profenofos from the halflives of 17.37 and 14.37 days in respective uninoculated soils. Growth dynamic studies indicated that all four B. subtilis strains were able to establish and proliferate on berries and soil equally well in the presence or absence of profenofos. Degradation product 4-bromo-2-chlorophenol was identiﬁed by GC-MS. Strain DR-39 was most eﬀective in the natural environments of grape and soil.},

In the pure culture, longer half-lives (t1/2 = 32.6–43.0 h) of cypermethrin were observed, as compared to the mixed cocultures (t1/2 = 13.0 h). The optimal degradation conditions were determined to be 28.2 °C and pH 7.5 based on response surface methodology (RSM). Under these conditions, the mixed cultures completely metabolized cypermethrin (50 mg LÀ1) within 72 h. Analysis of degradation products of cypermethrin indicated that the microbial consortium converted cypermethrin to a-hydroxy-3-phenoxy-benzeneacetonitrile, 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde and 4-phenoxyphenyl-2,2dimethyl-propiophenone, and subsequently transformed these compounds with a maximum speciﬁc degradation rate (qmax), half-saturation constant (Ks) and inhibition constant (Ki) of 0.1051 hÀ1, 31.2289 mg LÀ1 and 220.5752 mg LÀ1, respectively. This is the ﬁrst report of a proposed pathway of degradation of cypermethrin by hydrolysis of ester linkage and oxidization of 3-phenoxybenzyl in a coculture. Finally, this coculture is the ﬁrst described mixed microbial consortium capable of metabolizing cypermethrin.},

It is thus essential to exclude these toxicants from the ecosystem as quickly as possible. The feasible approaches to achieve such goals include biodegradation and biomineralization (utilization). The study was designed to determine the potential of Ps. putida MAS-1 to degrade / utilize chlorpyrifos. Gas chromatography studies revealed that Ps. putida MAS-1 degraded chlorpyrifos rapidly. For the final identification of Ps. putida MAS-1 PCR amplification of V4 variable regions of 16S rDNA was done which showed band size of 876 bp.

	abstract = {Pyrethoids are commonly used insecticide in both agricultural and urban environments. In this paper we describe isolation of a bacterium capable of degrading cypermethrin. The bacterium was isolated from a pesticide contaminated soil by enrichment technique with continuous pressure of cypermethrin as the sole carbon source and energy. Morphological, physiological and biochemical characterization of the bacterium indicated that it was a Pseudomonas species. The degradation ability of the isolate determined by resting cells study revealed that strainCyp19degrades cypermethrin upto 100\% within two days. Degradation of cypermethrin in unautoclaved inoculated and autoclaved inoculated soil was 97.5\% and 95\% respectively after 30-days of incubation studies, whereas it was insignificant in unautoclaved (uninoculated) and autoclaved (uninoculated) soil. The addition of strain Cyp19 (106 cells g-1) to soil with a low indigenous population of cypermethrin degrading bacteria treated with 40 ppm of cypermethrin g-1 resulted in a higher degradation rate than was observed in noninoculated soils. These results highlight the potential of this bacterium to be used in cleanup of contaminated pesticide waste in the environment.},

Chlorpyrifos is one of the major organophosphorous pesticides which is used to control insects including termites, beetles. The widespread use of these pesticides is hazardous to the environment and also toxic to mammals, thus it is essential to remove the same from the environment. From the chlorpyrifos contaminated soil nine morphologically different bacterial strains, one actinomycete and two fungal strains were isolated. Among those isolates four bacterial strains which were more efﬁcient were developed as consortium. The four bacterial isolates namely Pseudomonas putida (NII 1117), Klebsiella sp., (NII 1118), Pseudomonas stutzeri (NII 1119), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NII 1120) present in the consortia were identiﬁed on the basis of 16S rDNA analysis. The intracellular fractions of the consortium exhibited more organophosphorus hydrolase activity (0.171 ± 0.003 U/mL/min). The degradation studies were carried out at neutral pH and temperature 37°C with chlorpyrifos concentration 500 mg L-1. LC-mass spectral analysis showed the presence of metabolites chlopyrifosoxon and Diethylphosphorothioate. These results highlight an important potential use of this consortium for the cleanup of chlorpyrifos contaminated pesticide waste in the environment.},

Since dissolved oxygen concentration in groundwater is limited, this study aimed to investigate profenofos biodegradation and detoxiﬁcation under aerobic and anoxic conditions using the profenofos-degrading Pseudomonas plecoglossicida strain PF1 (PF1). Anoxic biodegradation under the presence of nitrate was the focus. The results showed that profenofos at 10–150 mg/L was degraded under aerobic and anoxic conditions with removal eﬃciencies of 38–55\% and 27–45\%, respectively. Kinetic analysis following the Michaelis-Menten model revealed that the maximum substrate degradation rates and the Michaelis constants were 13.07 and 8.92 mg/L/d and 92.07 and 84.76 mg/L under aerobic and anoxic conditions, respectively. The culture preferred an aerobic environment resulting in better biodegradation performance. During the degradation experiment, 4-bromo-2-chlorophenol and 1,1-dimethylethylphenol were detected as profenofos biodegradation intermediate products. Microbial toxicity, phytotoxicity, and cytogenotoxicity assays showed that the toxicity of the contaminated water signiﬁcantly decreased after both aerobic and anoxic biodegradation by PF1. The results from this study indicated that PF1 has the potential for bioremediation in a profenofos-contaminated environment under the presence or absence of oxygen.},

              Plant aerial surfaces comprise a complex habitat for microorganisms, and many plant-associated bacteria, such as the pathogen
              Pseudomonas syringae
              , exhibit density-dependent survival on leaves by utilizing quorum sensing (QS). QS is often mediated by diffusible signals called
              N
              -acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), and
              P. syringae
              utilizes

              -3-oxo-hexanoyl-
              dl
              -homoserine lactone (3OC6HSL) to control traits influencing epiphytic fitness and virulence. The
              P. syringae
              pathovar
              syringae
              B728a genome sequence revealed two putative AHL acylases, termed HacA (Psyr\_1971) and HacB (Psyr\_4858), which are N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases that inactivate AHLs by cleaving their amide bonds. HacA is a secreted AHL acylase that degrades only long-chain (C ≥ 8) AHLs, while HacB is not secreted and degrades all tested AHLs. Targeted disruptions of
              hacA, hacB
              , and

              and
              hacB

              hacB
              together confer complementable phenotypes that are very similar to autoaggregative phenotypes seen in other species. While AHL acylases might enable
              P. syringae
              B728a to degrade signals of competing species and block expression of their QS-dependent traits, these enzymes also play fundamental roles in biofilm formation.},

              Two distinctive colony morphologies were noted in a collection of
              Pseudomonas aeruginosa
              transposon insertion mutants. One set of mutants formed wrinkled colonies of autoaggregating cells. Suppressor analysis of a subset of these mutants showed that this was due to the action of the regulator WspR and linked this regulator (and the chemosensory pathway to which it belongs) to genes that encode a putative fimbrial adhesin required for biofilm formation. WspR homologs, related in part by a shared GGDEF domain, regulate cell surface factors, including aggregative fimbriae and exopolysaccharides, in diverse bacteria. The second set of distinctive insertion mutants formed colonies that lysed at their center. Strains with the most pronounced lysis overproduced the
              Pseudomonas
              quinolone signal (PQS), an extracellular signal that interacts with quorum sensing. Autolysis was suppressed by mutation of genes required for PQS biosynthesis, and in one suppressed mutant, autolysis was restored by addition of synthetic PQS. The mechanism of autolysis may involve activation of the endogenous prophage and phage-related pyocins in the genome of strain PAO1. The fact that PQS levels correlated with autolysis suggests a fine balance in natural populations of
              P. aeruginosa
              between survival of the many and persistence of the few.},

Via response surface methodology analysis, we found the optimal condition was 29.4 °C, pH 7.0, and inocula biomass of 0.15 g LÀ1; under these conditions, about 90\% of the beta-cypermethrin could be degraded within 12 days. Noticeably, biosurfactant was detected in the MSM culture of strain CH7, suggesting that the biosurfactant (rhamnolipid) could potentially enhance the degradation of beta-cypermethrin by promoting the dissolution, adsorption, and absorption of the hydrophobic compounds. Therefore, CH7 may serve as a promising strain in the bioremediation of wastewater and soil polluted by beta-cypermethrin.},

	abstract = {Methomyl \{bis[1-methylthioacetaldehyde-O-(N-methylcarbamoyl)oximino] sulﬁde\} is a highly toxic oxime carbamate insecticide. Several methomyl-degrading microorganisms have been reported so far, but the role of speciﬁc enzymes and genes in this process is still unexplored. In this study, a protein annotated as a carbamate C-N hydrolase was identiﬁed in the methomyl-degrading strain Aminobacter aminovorans MDW-2, and the encoding gene was termed ameH. A comparative analysis between the mass ﬁngerprints of AmeH and deduced proteins of the strain MDW-2 genome revealed AmeH to be a key enzyme of the detoxiﬁcation step of methomyl degradation. The results also demonstrated that AmeH was a functional homodimer with a subunit molecular mass of approximately 34 kDa and shared the highest identity (27\%) with the putative formamidase from Schizosaccharomyces pombe ATCC 24843. AmeH displayed maximal enzymatic activity at 50°C and pH 8.5. Km and kcat of AmeH for methomyl were 87.5 ␮M and 345.2 sϪ1, respectively, and catalytic efﬁciency (kcat/Km) was 3.9 ␮MϪ1 sϪ1. Phylogenetic analysis revealed AmeH to be a member of the FmdA\_AmdA superfamily. Additionally, ﬁve key amino acid residues (162, 164, 191, 193, and 207) of AmeH were identiﬁed by amino acid variations.},

	abstract = {A strain coded AS 1.2343 was isolated from oil-contaminated soil in an oil-ﬁeld in North China Tianjian City and it was identiﬁed as Pseudomonas nitroreducens. The strain demonstrated some unusual ability to synthesize polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) homopolymer from medium-chain-length (mcl) fatty acids including hexanoate and octanoate. While polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) consisting of mcl hydroxyalkanoate (HA) monomers such as hydroxyoctanoate (HO) and hydroxydecanoate (HD) were the major compositions when butyrate, decanoate, lauric acid and tetradecanoic acid were used as substrates for the cell growth, respectively. PHA was accumulated up to 77\% of the cell dry weight when growth was conducted in lauric acid, it appeared that the HA contents in the PHA would not be much affected by the changing of the lauric acid concentration. Varying the concentration ratio of butyrate to octanoate could change the composition of PHA accumulated by the strain. Yet PHB homopolymer was always the only polyester synthesized by the strain, regardless of the octanoate concentration change. Additionally, the ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C/N) in butyrate media was found to have effects on the PHA monomer content, as C/N increased from 2 to 100, content of HB decreased from 100\% to 7\%. PHA polyester synthesized by cells of Pseudomonas nitroreducens AS 1.2343 was a blend polymers consisting of acetone-insoluble HB and acetone-soluble mcl HA monomers.},

	abstract = {Recent studies showed that synthetic pyrethroids (SPs) can move via surface runoff into aquatic systems. Fifty-six of SP-degrading bacteria strains were isolated from contaminated sediments, of which six were evaluated for their ability to transform bifenthrin and permethrin in the aqueous phase and bifenthrin in the sediment phase. In the aqueous phase, bifenthrin was rapidly degraded by strains of Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila, and the half-life (t1/2) was reduced from Ͼ700 h to 30 to 131 h. Permethrin isomers were degraded by Aeromonas sobria, Erwinia carotovora, and Yersinia frederiksenii. Similar to bifenthrin, the t1/2 of cisand trans-permethrin was reduced by approximately 10-fold after bacteria inoculation. However, bifenthrin degradation by S. acidaminiphila was signiﬁcantly inhibited in the presence of sediment, and the effect was likely caused by strong adsorption to the solid phase. Bifenthrin t1/2 was 343 to 466 h for a ﬁeld sediment, and increased to 980 to 1200 h for a creek sediment. Bifenthrin degradation in the inoculated slurry treatments was not greatly enhanced when compared with the noninoculated system. Therefore, although SP-degrading bacteria may be widespread in aquatic systems, adsorption to sediment could render SPs unavailable to the degraders, thus prolonging their persistence.},

Capturing multiple two-dimensional images at different depths in a sample enables the reconstruction of three-dimensional structures (a process known as optical sectioning) within an object. This technique is used extensively in the scientific and industrial communities and typical applications are in life sciences, semiconductor inspection and materials science.
Light travels through the sample under a conventional microscope as far into the specimen as it can penetrate, while a confocal microscope only focuses a smaller beam of light at one narrow depth level at a time. The CLSM achieves a controlled and highly limited depth of focus.},

	abstract = {To obtain a higher resolution of the phylogenetic relationships of species within a genus or genera within a family, multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) is currently a widely used method. In MLSA studies, partial sequences of genes coding for proteins with conserved functions (‘housekeeping genes’) are used to generate phylogenetic trees and subsequently deduce phylogenies. However, MLSA is not only suggested as a phylogenetic tool to support and clarify the resolution of bacterial species with a higher resolution, as in 16S rRNA gene-based studies, but has also been discussed as a replacement for DNA–DNA hybridization (DDH) in species delineation. Nevertheless, despite the fact that MLSA has become an accepted and widely used method in prokaryotic taxonomy, no common generally accepted recommendations have been devised to date for either the whole area of microbial taxonomy or for taxa-specific applications of individual MLSA schemes. The different ways MLSA is performed can vary greatly for the selection of genes, their number, and the calculation method used when comparing the sequences obtained. Here, we provide an overview of the historical development of MLSA and critically review its current application in prokaryotic taxonomy by highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the method's numerous variations. This provides a perspective for its future use in forthcoming genome-based genotypic taxonomic analyses.},

	abstract = {The physical and chemical properties of biochar vary based on feedstock sources and production conditions, making it possible to engineer biochars with specific functions (e.g. carbon sequestration, soil quality improvements, or contaminant sorption). In 2013, the International Biochar Initiative (IBI) made publically available their Standardized Product Definition and Product Testing Guidelines (Version 1.1) which set standards for physical and chemical characteristics for biochar. Six biochars made from three different feedstocks and at two temperatures were analyzed for characteristics related to their use as a soil amendment. The protocol describes analyses of the feedstocks and biochars and includes: cation exchange capacity (CEC), specific surface area (SSA), organic carbon (OC) and moisture percentage, pH, particle size distribution, and proximate and ultimate analysis. Also described in the protocol are the analyses of the feedstocks and biochars for contaminants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), metals and mercury as well as nutrients (phosphorous, nitrite and nitrate and ammonium as nitrogen). The protocol also includes the biological testing procedures, earthworm avoidance and germination assays. Based on the quality assurance / quality control (QA/QC) results of blanks, duplicates, standards and reference materials, all methods were determined adequate for use with biochar and feedstock materials. All biochars and feedstocks were well within the criterion set by the IBI and there were little differences among biochars, except in the case of the biochar produced from construction waste materials. This biochar (referred to as Old biochar) was determined to have elevated levels of arsenic, chromium, copper, and lead, and failed the earthworm avoidance and germination assays. Based on these results, Old biochar would not be appropriate for use as a soil amendment for carbon sequestration, substrate quality improvements or remediation.},

	abstract = {Microbial communities are involved in many vital biological processes from elemental cycles to sustaining human health. The bacterial assemblages are remarkably under-studied as they are reluctant to grow in the laboratory conditions. Therefore, alternative omics-based approaches and computational modelling methods have been an active area of research to investigate microbial communities physiologically, ecologically and biochemically. In this thesis different microbial consortia involved in food production and also the human gut microbiota have been modelled and investigated. In the case of the human gut microbiota, the effects of malnutrition on the overall health of children from three different countries, namely, Malawi and Bangladesh, and Sweden have been studied. In each of the first two countries, a group of malnourished children going through food therapy as well as a healthy cohort were monitored to investigate the effect of food intervention on malnutrition, with their gut microbiota being the focal point. In this project, using metagenomics data we identified the dominant strains in each cohort, reconstructed genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) for the most abundant ones and used our models to predict diet-microbe, microbe-microbe, and microbehost interactions. Based on our results in this project, in addition to being less diverse, the gut microbiota of malnourished children showed a lower potency regarding the production of valuable metabolites. The second investigated microbial consortia were the ones used in fermented milk products. Based on the genome sequence and also experimental data for five selected strains, we reconstructed GEMs, curated the models and performed community modelling to predict their metabolic interactions. Using the simulation outcomes, we could predict a ratio for bacterial strains used in yogurt starter culture to maximise the production of acetaldehyde which is a key contributor to yogurt’s unique taste and aroma.},

The developed computational tools can also be used to analyze and describe biofilm formation by other bacterial species in vivo., Biofilms formed by nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) bacteria play an important role in multiple respiratory tract diseases. Visual inspection of the morphology of biofilms formed during chronic infections shows distinct differences from biofilms formed in vitro. To better understand these differences, we analyzed images of NTHI biofilms formed in the middle ears of Chinchilla lanigera and developed an in silico agent-based model of the formation of NTHI biofilms in vivo. We found that, as in vitro, NTHI bacteria are organized in self-similar patterns; however, the sizes of NTHI clusters in vivo are more than 10-fold smaller than their in vitro counterparts. The agent-based model reproduced these patterns and suggested that smaller clusters occur due to elimination of planktonic NTHI cells by the host responses. Estimation of model parameters by fitting simulation results to imaging data showed that the effects of several processes in the model change during the course of the infection., IMPORTANCE Multiple respiratory illnesses are associated with formation of biofilms within the human airway by NTHI.

	abstract = {Several inland water bodies in the St. Louis Bay watershed have been identiﬁed as being potentially impaired due to low level of dissolved oxygen (DO). In order to calculate the total maximum daily loads (TMDL), a standard watershed model supported by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Hydrological Simulation Program Fortran (HSPF), was used to simulate water temperature, DO, and bio-chemical oxygen demand (BOD). Both point and non-point sources of BOD were included in watershed modeling. The developed model was calibrated at two time periods: 1978 to 1986 and 2000 to 2001 with simulated DO closely matched the observed data and captured the seasonal variations. The model represented the general trend and average condition of observed BOD. Water temperature and BOD decay are the major factors that affect DO simulation, whereas nutrient processes, including nitriﬁcation, denitriﬁcation, and phytoplankton cycle, have slight impacts. The calibrated water quality model provides a representative linkage between the sources of BOD and in-stream DO{\textbackslash}BOD concentrations. The developed input parameters in this research could be extended to similar coastal watersheds for TMDL determination and Best Management Practice (BMP) evaluation.},

	abstract = {Soil contamination by heavy metals threatens the quality of agricultural products and human health, so it is necessary to choose certain economic and effective remediation techniques to control the continuous deterioration of land quality. This paper is intended to present an overview on the application of biochar as an addition to the remediation of heavy-metal-contaminated soil, in terms of its preparation technologies and performance characteristics, remediation mechanisms and effects, and impacts on heavy metal bioavailability. Biochar is a carbon-neutral or carbon-negative product produced by the thermochemical transformation of plant- and animal-based biomass. Biochar shows numerous advantages in increasing soil pH value and organic carbon content, improving soil water-holding capacity, reducing the available fraction of heavy metals, increasing agricultural crop yield and inhibiting the uptake and accumulation of heavy metals. Different conditions, such as biomass type, pyrolysis temperature, heating rate and residence time are the pivotal factors governing the performance characteristics of biochar. Affected by the pH value and dissolved organic carbon and ash content of biochar, the interaction mechanisms between biochar and heavy metals mainly includes complexation, reduction, cation exchange, electrostatic attraction and precipitation. Finally, the potential risks of in-situ remediation strategy of biochar are expounded upon, which provides the directions for future research to ensure the safe production and sustainable utilization of biochar.},

Biochar, a carbon rich source application ameliorates this stress by increasing the plant growth, biomass, nutrient uptake and improves gaseous exchange in drought stress. Application of biochar reduces drought stress by increasing water holding capacity of soil through modification of soil physio-chemical properties that in turn increases water availability to plants and also enhances mineral uptake and regulation of stomatal conductance. Biochar mediates in the retention of moisture, nutrients, inhibits harmful bacteria, absorbs heavy metals, pesticides, prevents soil erosion, increases soil pH, improves cationic exchange and boosts soil fertility. Drought and heavy metal stress often lead to production of reactive oxygen species. However, biochar significantly modifies the Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) scavenging enzymes and provides an efficient electron transferring mechanism to tackle the toxic effects of ROS in plants. Biochar is regarded as a tool for the effective management of agricultural productivity and various environmental issues. This review provides insights on the potential role of biochar in ameliorating drought and heavy metal stress.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Combining these is an innovative concept which can result in improvements in pollutant removal since both, biochar and algae have the ability for adsorbing/ absorbing pollutants. Additionally, only limited work on embedding freshwater algae (common algae existing in surface water and having low ecological risks since they are native species) into biochar for the removal of water pollutants has been undertaken to-date. It was found that Bc-Cp beads prepared using 10 mL of algae (9 × 108 cell/mL), 0.3 g of biochar, 40 g/L of sodium alginate, and 20 g/L of CaCl2 displayed the optimum characteristics including mechanical strength (2.548 N), promotion of algae growth (191.70 \% growth rate) and pollutant removal ability with the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen and total phosphorus, total organic carbon, zinc and copper were up to 69.2 \%, 43.0 \%, 73.8 \%, 81.0 \%, 74.4 \% and 81.0 \%, respectively. The algae within the beads were primarily responsible for the removal of nutrients by assimilation, while biochar mainly exerted influence on the removal of organic matter and heavy metals by chemisorption. The study outcomes also confirmed that Bc-Cp beads possess high potential to be used in estuarine environments and saline groundwater.},

	abstract = {The discovery of cheap and eco-friendly functional materials for the removal of anionic heavy metal ions is still challenging in the treatment of heavy metal-contaminated water. Herein, a new poly(allyltrimethylammonium) grafted chitosan and biochar composite (PATMAC-CTS-BC) was introduced for the removal of selenate (SeO42− ) in water. Results suggest that the PATMAC-CTS-BC showed a rapid removal of SeO42− with efficiency of {\textgreater}97\% within 10 min and it followed a pseudo-second-order model. High capacity of SeO42− adsorption by the composite was achieved, with maximum value of 98.99 mg g− 1 based on Langmuir model, considerably higher than most of reported adsorbents. The thermodynamic results reflected the spontaneous and exothermic nature of SeO42− adsorption onto the composite. The composite could be applied at a wide initial pH range (2–10) with high removal efficiency of SeO42− because of permanent positive charges of quaternary ammonium groups (=N+–). The removal mechanisms of SeO42− were mainly attributed to electrostatic interactions with =N+– and proton­ ated –NH3+ groups, and redox-complexation interactions with –NH2, –NH–, and –OH groups. Besides SeO42− , the hexavalent chromium (Cr2O72− ) was considered as example to further demonstrate the anion removal capability of cationic hydrogel-BC composite. The study outcomes open up new opportunities to efficiently remove anionic heavy metal ions (e.g., SeO42− and Cr2O72− ) in water using these materials.},

	abstract = {Trong hóa học, năng lượng liên kết (E) hoặc entanpy liên kết (H) là thước đo độ bền liên kết trong liên kết hóa học. Theo IUPAC, năng lượng liên kết là giá trị trung bình của năng lượng phân ly liên kết trong pha khí (thường ở nhiệt độ 298K) cho tất cả các liên kết cùng loại trong cùng loại hóa chất. Theo sách giáo khoa Hóa học 10 của nhà xuất bản giáo dục Việt Nam, năng lượng của một liên kết hoá học là năng lượng cần thiết để phá vỡ liên kết đó và thành nguyên tử ở thể khí. Ví dụ, năng lượng liên kết cacbon–hidro trong metan H(C–H) là sự thay đổi entanpy để phá vỡ một phân tử metan thành một nguyên tử carbon và bốn gốc hydro tự do. Bảng năng lượng liên kết liệt kê các giá trị của năng lượng liên kết trung bình trong phân tử có chứa một số loại liên kết hóa học điển hình. Năng lượng liên kết (E) hoặc entanpy liên kết (H) không nên bị nhầm lẫn với năng lượng phá vỡ liên kết (D). Năng lượng liên kết là trung bình của tất cả các năng lượng phá vỡ liên kết trong một phân tử, và sẽ cho giá trị khác nhau cho một liên kết nhất định so với năng lượng phá vỡ liên kết. Điều này là do năng lượng cần thiết để phá vỡ một liên kết đơn trong một phân tử cụ thể là khác nhau giữa các liên kết trong phân tử đó. Ví dụ, metan có bốn liên kết C–H, năng lượng phá vỡ liên kết D(CH3–H) = 435kJ/mol, D(CH2–H) = 444 kJ/mol, D(CH–H) = 444kJ/mol và D(C–H) = 339 kJ/mol. Vậy năng lượng liên kết trung bình là 414 kJ/mol, giá trị này khác 4 giá trị năng lượng phá vỡ liên kết nêu trên.},

	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Markup_language&oldid=991543750},
	abstract = {In computer text processing, a markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, meaning when the document is processed for display, the markup language is not shown, and is only used to format the text. The idea and terminology evolved from the "marking up" of paper manuscripts (i.e., the revision instructions by editors), which is traditionally written with a red pen or blue pencil on authors' manuscripts. Such "markup" typically includes both content corrections (such as spelling, punctuation, or movement of content), and also typographic instructions, such as to make a heading larger or boldface.
In digital media, this "blue pencil instruction text" was replaced by tags which ideally indicate what the parts of the document are, rather than details of how they might be shown on some display. This lets authors avoid formatting every instance of the same kind of thing redundantly (and possibly inconsistently). It also avoids the specification of fonts and dimensions which may not apply to many users (such as those with different-size displays, impaired vision and screen-reading software).
Early markup systems typically included typesetting instructions, as troff, TeX and LaTeX do, while Scribe and most modern markup systems name components, and later process those names to apply formatting or other processing, as in the case of XML.
Some markup languages, such as the widely used HTML, have pre-defined presentation semantics—meaning that their specification prescribes some aspects of how to present the structured data on particular media. HTML, like DocBook, Open eBook, JATS and countless others, is a specific application of the markup meta-languages SGML and XML. That is, SGML and XML enable users to specify particular schemas, which determine just what elements, attributes, and other features are permitted, and where.
One extremely important characteristic of most markup languages is that they allow mixing markup directly into text streams. This happens all the time in documents: A few words in a sentence must be emphasized, or identified as a proper name, defined term, or other special item. This is quite different structurally from traditional databases, where it is by definition impossible to have data that is (for example) within a record, but not within any field. Likewise, markup for natural language texts must maintain ordering: it would not suffice to make each paragraph of a book into a "paragraph" record, where those records do not maintain order.},

This research was taken place in the Pb contaminated paddy soil using a randomized complete block design with three factors and three replicates. This research employed combination of inorganic fertilizer, ramie and Agrobacterium sp. I3 or compost as a chelator to improve Pb uptake. The results showed that combination of the three treatments increased Pb uptake. The combination of chemical fertilizers, ramie with compost increased the Pb uptake of 11.93 μg/g or 45.9\%. The combination of chemical fertilizers, ramie with Agrobacterium sp. I3 resulted in the highest Pb uptake of 12.85 μg/g or 49.8\%. The combination also decreased the soil Pb level by 7.8 μg/g or 23.5\% of the control.},

As a consequence, scientists have published thousands of reports. Writing an effective article is generally a significant problem for researchers. All parts of an article, specifically the abstract, material and methods, results, discussion and references sections should contain certain features that should always be considered before sending a manuscript to a journal for publication. It is generally known that the material and methods section is a relatively easy section of an article to write. Therefore, it is often a good idea to begin by writing the materials and methods section, which is also a crucial part of an article. Because “reproducible results” are very important in science, a detailed account of the study should be given in this section. If the authors provide sufficient detail, other scientists can repeat their experiments to verify their findings. It is generally recommended that the materials and methods should be written in the past tense, either in active or passive voice. In this section, ethical approval, study dates, number of subjects, groups, evaluation criteria, exclusion criteria and statistical methods should be described sequentially. It should be noted that a well-written materials and methods section markedly enhances the chances of an article being published.},

The chemo-physical and microstructural properties characterization methods included monitoring of electrical conductivity and pH variations of saturated lime–RHA solution, X-ray fluorescence, and diffraction. To assess the pozzolanic performance of RHA, a control mortar was produced as a reference with a water-to-cement ratio of 0.45 and a flow of 84\%, and three cement replacement percentages by RHA of 5, 10, and 15\% were applied for each retention time. The results show that with an increase in retention time, the EC and pH changes steadily decrease, suggesting lower RHA reactivity at longer retention times. However, no crystalline phases were found in RHA up to 32-h combustion, primarily because of the rapid cooling of the yield ash. In contrast, the compressive strength of RHA blended mortars increases up to 4 h combustion and then decreases. A possible explanation for the lower strength activity of short retention time RHA is offered in this study. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000426. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

The results revealed that, inoculation with lignocellulolytic fungus (LCF) Aspergillus sp. @ 2\% was considered as the most efﬁcient method of composting within a short period. Characterization of composted rice husk (CRH) was examined through scanning electron microscope (SEM) for identifying signiﬁcant structural changes. At the end of composting, N, P and K content increased with decrease in CO2 evolution, C:N and C:P ratios. In comparison to inorganic fertilization, an increase in grain yield of 16\% in typic Haplustalf and 17\% in typic Rhodustalf soil over 100\% RDF was obtained from the integrated application of CRH@ 5 t ha−1 with 50\% RDF and biofertilizers.

The Cherry cultivar showed higher plant growth, fruit yield and mean fruit size. The Grape cultivar produced fruits with higher sugar concentration. For the Grape cultivar, the removal of one sympodium leaf did not affect the plant responses. However, for the Cherry cultivar, it was necessary to maintain the complete sympodium.

	abstract = {The objective of this investigation is to evaluate the electrical conductivity of activated carbon derived from rice husk (RHAC) by a twostage process. dc conductivity measurements by two-probe method were determined for RHAC samples prepared at 700, 800 and 900 ◦C. The samples were compressed in the pressure range 75.9–578.2 kPa in a hollow glass cylinder using two metal plungers connected to a Keithley ammeter. The conductivity at room temperature was found to increase from 3.28 × 10−4 to 2.02 × 10−3 S cm−1 for increase in compression pressure. Dense packing of the material, collapse of pores and decrease in air gap between the carbon particles could be the factors for the increase in conductivity with compression pressures. The temperature-dependent conductivity of RHAC samples were determined by compressing the sample within the metal plungers, followed by heating in a tubular furnace. A K-type thermocouple whose hot junction was located in close proximity to the specimen, was used to monitor the temperature accurately. The specimen inside the furnace was heated by a microprocessor-controlled programmer up to 250 ◦C. The temperature-dependent conductivity study conducted for the samples activated at 700, 800 and 900 ◦C, revealed that the energy gap value of the samples were 0.1023, 0.0745 and 0.052 eV respectively, determined from the linear plot of ln I versus 1/T (K−1). The mesoporous RHAC samples were characterized using electron spin resonance, FT-IR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction for quantitative evaluation of free electrons, functional groups and crystallites to support the mechanism of electrical conduction in mesoporous nonsinterable carbon samples.},

A comparative study was carried out to produce silica nanoparticles (S-SiO2, R-SiO2, and B-SiO2) from three type of rice husk ashes (sticky, red, and brown). The microstructure of m-SiO2 was dependent on the geographical provenance and the types of RHA. An analysis of the SEM and TEM micrographs reveals that the S-SiO2 nanoparticles had a clustered spherical shape, while R-SiO2 and B-SiO2 nanoparticles were found to be purely spherical. The average crystallite size of S-SiO2, R-SiO2 and B-SiO2 nanoparticles evaluated from the TEM measurements were observed to be 50, 20 and 10 nm, respectively. The XRD pattern of silica nanopowders had an absence of sharp peaks that conﬁrmed the amorphous nature of the material. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of silica nanoparticles showed the symmetric Si–O and O–Si–O stretching bond vibrations at 462, 1088, and 1098 cmÀ1. The surface area of S-SiO2, R-SiO2 and B-SiO2 nanopowders was measured to be 7.5513, 201.45, and 247.18 m2 gÀ1, respectively. The surface area of uniformly-distributed spherical nanoparticles of B-SiO2 was observed the highest, which can be applied for the application of energy storage and drug delivery systems.},

	abstract = {With the rise in global population and increased agricultural requirements comes an increasing need for freshwater. Currently, it is estimated that approximately 75\% of fresh water consumption is for the growth of agricultural crops, and only 10\% to 30\% of this water is actually made available to plants. It is widely accepted that farming practices which rely heavily on chemical fertilizers and unsustainable land management practices have led in many regions to infertile sandy soils with reduced water holding capacity and insufficient amounts of organic matter. Combined with increasing global population, the need to better manage fresh water use, particularly agricultural usage, is paramount. The use of biochar as a soil amendment has been suggested as a way to increase water holding capacity, but only limited quantitative studies exist in terms of the effectiveness of biochar in increasing a soil's water holding capacity. The main purpose of this study was to determine the effect of woody biochar amendment (yellow pine from pyrolysis at 400°C) on the water holding capacity of loamy sand soil with different mixture rates. Results show a doubling in water holding capacity by mass using a 9\% mixture of biochar (equivalent to 195 metric ton/ha), which is an agriculturally relevant concentration. High percentage mixtures of biochar increase water holding capacity dramatically. These results suggest the use of biochar has potential to mitigate drought and increase crop yields in loamy sand soil.},

	abstract = {Climate change has been threatening the sustainable development of the agricultural sector around the globe. It is a main reason of prolonged drought which gives negative effects on productivity and quality of agricultural products. For solving these emerging challenges, there have been many solutions on improving soil health in order to increase the tolerance of soil and plant to adverse weather conditions. Recent researches on biochar show that this is a good soil amendment because of its water holding capacity, nutrient retention, increased porosity and enhanced soil microbial activity. This study investigated the effect of biochar from rice husk and coffee husk produced by gasifier on the ability to retain water and moisture in basalt and grey soil, which collected from farming areas in Vietnam. The result illustrates that water holding capacity and soil moisture depend significantly on each type of biochar and applied dosage as well as characteristic of soil. Accordingly, when adding 1\% biochar by mass to the grey soil (initial moisture content of 13\%) helped increase the efficiency of water holding capacity by 26-33\% corresponding to coffee husk or rice husk biochar. It is different from basalt soil (initial moisture content of 27\%) when adding 1\% rice husk biochar will impact on water retention efficiency was 7\%, equivalent to 3\% biochar from coffee husk. Therefore, biochar can be introduced as a soil conditioner effectively in dry soil or enhance the water retention in fertile soil that eventually contributed to the sustainable agriculture.},

We present a systematic review of literature published between 2010 and 2018 to test the hypothesis that sorption capacity and affinity are affected by biochar properties, attributes of the metal contaminant, and experimental conditions, in that order. We used random forest (RF) and multi-objective optimization to analyze data of 559 individual Langmuir adsorption isotherms extracted from 133 studies covering the sorption capacity (Cmax) and affinity (KL) of biochar for 17 different metals, elaborated from six different feedstock classes, three different types of feedstock pretreatment, and five types of post-pyrolysis treatment. Highest sorption values were obtained for Pb(II), Cr(IV), and Cd(II). The feedstock used was the key determinant influencing biochar’s capacity and affinity to sorb metal contaminants (first and fourth most important variable in RF models for Cmax and KL, respectively) with best results obtained for biochar elaborated from nutrient-dense feedstocks (animal biowaste, sludge, and manure). Biochars that had both high sorption capacity and affinity were the result of a longer duration of pyrolysis; they had lower C and higher N and O content, as well as lower C/N and higher O/C and H/C ratios, higher pore volumes and higher pH. Applying some form of pretreatment was better than none, whereas chemical modification was the best of the post-treatment methods analyzed. This review demonstrates clearly that multiple parameters during the preparation process influence the effectiveness of biochar to immobilize metal contaminants. Future research that focuses on mechanisms and the underlying factors for the correlations observed should allow the development of biochar formulations that are even more effective at immobilizing metal contaminants in soils and sediments.},

Based on previous literature, we develop an artifact that partially automates the literature review process from collecting articles up to their evaluation. This artifact uses a custom crawler, the word2vec algorithm, LDA topic modeling, rapid automatic keyword extraction, and agglomerative hierarchical clustering to enable the automatic acquisition, processing, and clustering of relevant literature and subsequent graphical presentation of the results using illustrations such as dendrograms. Moreover, the artifact provides information on which topics each cluster addresses and which keywords they contain. We evaluate our artifact based on an exemplary set of 308 publications. Our findings indicate that the developed artifact delivers better results than known previous approaches and can be a helpful tool to support researchers in conducting literature reviews.},

	title = {A guide to performing systematic literature reviews in bioinformatics},
	abstract = {Bioinformatics research depends on high-quality databases to provide accurate results. In silico experiments, correctly performed, may prospect novel discoveries and elucidates pathways for biological experiments through data analysis in large scale. However, most biological databases have presented mistakes, such as data incorrectly classified or incomplete information. Also, sometimes, data mining algorithms cannot treat these errors, leading to serious problems for the in silico analysis. Manual curation of data extracted from literature is a possible solution for this problem. Systematic Literature Review (SLR), or Systematic Review, is a method to identify, evaluate and summarize the state-of-the-art of a specific theme. Moreover, SLR allows the collection from databases restrictively, which allows an analysis with lower bias than traditional reviews. The SRL approaches have been widely used for decisionmaking in medical and environmental studies. However, other research areas, such as bioinformatics, do not have a specific step-by-step to guide researchers undertaking the procedures of an SLR. In this study, we propose a guideline, called BiSRL, to perform SLR in bioinformatics. Our procedures cover the most traditional guides to produce SLRs adapted to bioinformatics. To evaluate our method, we propose a case study to detect and summarize SLRs developed for bioinformatics data. We used two databases: PubMed and ScienceDirect. A total of 207 papers were screened in four steps: title, abstract, diagonal reading, and full-text reading. Four evaluators performed the SLR independently to reduce bias risk. A total of eight papers was included in the SLR case study. The case study demonstrates how to implement the methods of BiSLR to procedure SLR for bioinformatics. BiSLR may guide bioinformaticians to perform systematic reviews reproducible to collect accurate data for higher quality analysis.},

Sixteen bull calves were, for 4 weeks, provided equal access to a panel of 8 automated feed bunks in a single paddock with some hay. Each bunk contained pellets with (H57) or without (Control) the H57, each aged for 4 months at either ambient or chiller temperature. Each treatment was changed to a new bunk pair position weekly. Relative preference was determined according to weight of pellets remaining per hour per treatment bunk pair per 24 h. Pellets were analysed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and the concentrations tested for correlation with relative preference. Calves showed the lowest preference (p {\textless} 0.0001) for the Control/Ambient treatment whereas preference for all other treatments (H57/Ambient; H57/Chiller; Control/Chiller) was similar. The Control/Ambient treatment odour proﬁle grouped differently to the other 3 treatments which grouped similarly to each other. Up to 16 mVOCs were determined to have potential as pre-ingestive signals for the extent of microbial spoilage. Further studies are required to ﬁnd which combination of these mVOCs, when added to pellets, results in feed aversion.},

	abstract = {Activated carbon (AC) was synthesized from golden shower (GS) through a new chemical activation process. The three-stage process comprised (1) hydrothermal carbonization of GS to produce hydrochar, (2) pyrolysis of hydrochar to produce biochar, and (3) subsequent chemical activation of biochar with K2CO3 to obtain GSHBAC. The traditional synthesis processes (i.e., one-stage and two-stage) were also examined for comparison. In the one-stage process, GS that was impregnated with K2CO3 was directly pyrolyzed (GSAC), and the two-stage process consisted of (1) pyrolytic or hydrothermal carbonization to produce biochar or hydrochar and (2) subsequent chemical activation was deﬁned as GSBAC and GSHAC, respectively. The synthesized ACs were characterized by scanning electron microscope, Brunauer eEmmetteTeller (BET) surface area analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, point zero charge, and Boehm titration. The adsorption results demonstrated that the MG5 adsorption process was not remarkably affected by neither the solution pH (2.0e10) nor ionic strength (0e0.5 M NaCl). Kinetic studies showed that the adsorption equilibrium was quickly established, with a low activation energy required for adsorption (Ea; 3.30e27.8 kJ/mol), and the ACs removed 50e73\% of the MG5 concentration from solution within 01 min. Desorption studies conﬁrmed the adsorption was irreversible. Thermodynamic experiments suggested that the MG5 adsorption was spontaneous (ÀDG ) and endothermic (þDH ), and increased the randomness (þDS ) in the system. Although the speciﬁc surface areas of the ACs followed the order GSAC (1,413) {\textgreater} GSHAC (1,238) {\textgreater} GSHBAC (903) {\textgreater} GSBAC (812 m2/g), the maximum adsorption capacities determined from the Langmuir model (Qomax) at 30  C exhibited the following order: GSHBAC (531) {\textgreater} GSAC (344) {\textgreater} GSHAC (332) {\textgreater} GSBAC (253 mg/g). Oxygenation of the ACs' surface through a hydrothermal process with acrylic acid resulted in a decrease in MG5 adsorption and identiﬁed the importance of p-p interactions to the adsorption process. The primary interactions in MG5 adsorption were p-p interactions and pore ﬁlling, while hydrogen bonding and n-p interactions were minor contributors. The three-stage process can be regarded as the effective preparation method of AC with a high adsorption capacity toward the cationic dye.},

	abstract = {Biochar is an effective absorbent for remediating heavy metal contaminated soil, but functional optimization is still needed to improve its performance in field application. Here, we characterized the physical structures and surface chemical properties of raw wood biochar and palm biochar (WB and PB) and the corresponding sulfhydryl-modified biochar (SWB and SPB). Their adsorption capacity for Pb was evaluated by combining thermodynamic and kinetic adsorption at 0.01 mol/L KCl and corresponding model simulation. The results demonstrated successful grafting of sulfhydryl groups onto the biochar, which dramatically reduced the specific surface area (SSA) and pore volume of biochar. The pKa in the surface complexation model (SCM) indicated similar proton affinity between sulfhydryl groups and original functional groups on the biochar. SCM could satisfactorily fit the Pb adsorption behaviors, and model analysis revealed that Pb tended to be adsorbed on low-proton affinity sites at low pH, but high-proton affinity sites became dominant in Pb adsorption with increasing pH and adsorbed almost all Pb ions at pH {\textgreater} 7.0. Besides, the Pb adsorption density of SWB and SPB was improved by 8.86 and 3.64 folds relative to that of WB and PB, respectively. Over 90\% of initially added Pb ions were removed in 1440 and 720 min by raw and sulfhydryl-modified biochar, respectively, indicating that sulfhydryl modification accelerated the Pb adsorption of biochar. These results suggest that site density, SSA and pore structure of biochar play crucial roles in heavy metal adsorption, and sulfhydryl modification may improve the performance of biochar in remediating heavy metal contaminated soil.},

This study was undertaken to evaluate the performance of the conceptual energy and water recovery system for the Nano Membrane Toilet designed for a household of ten people and to assess its self-sustainability. A process model of the entire system, including the thermochemical conversion island, a Stirling engine and a water recovery system was developed in Aspen PlusÒ.

Additionally, if no supernatant was processed, the speciﬁc net power output was increased to 69.2 Wh/kgsettledsolids. Such household-scale system would deliver the net power output (1.9–5.8 W). This was found to be enough to charge mobile phones or power clock radios, or provide light for the household using low-voltage LED bulbs.},

Two bio-solar cells are integrated on a single chip and con­ nected in series, continuously generating light-responsive electricity from heterotrophic bacterial respiration with the organic substrates produced by photosynthetic autotrophs. Agar-based anolyte, catholyte, and saltbridge provided solid-state ionic environments for more efficient syntrophic interactions between co-cultures without bacterial competition, further enhancing the device performance and lifespan. The solid-phase plat­ form allows versatile device configuration in a small footprint without a cumbersome fluidic feeding system and permits easy integration and operation with solid-state applications. The device is sealed with a gas-permeable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane to facilitate gas exchange to the bacteria and cathodic reactions, even ideally allowing for replenishing bacterial gasses from environments for self-sustainable energy harvesting. A DCDC booster circuit is integrated with the stacked bio-solar cells to increase the operational voltage ({\textasciitilde}500 mV) to a maximum output of {\textgreater}3 V for self-powering an on-chip, light-emitting diode (LED).

Equilibrium and kinetic data were modeled using well-known isotherm and kinetic models. Results deviated largely from Langmuir monolayer, Freundlich multilayer and extended Langmuir isotherm models suggesting a mutual interaction of the adsorbates in solution which is shown with data obtained from competitive adsorption evaluation.

A batch of adsorption experiments were conducted by using norfloxacin (NFO), tetracycline (TC) and ofloxacin (OFO) as the model antibiotic molecules. The results indicate that the adsorption of antibiotics on UHTNs is better fitted to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and the UHTNs' maximum adsorption capacities calculated from the Langmuir isotherm model were 151.51 mg g

              −1
              for OFO at pH = 7, which are far better than those of most reported inorganic adsorbent materials. In the adsorption process of tetracycline, the surface complexation between the adsorbent and TC contributed most to the adsorption; this has been elucidated by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In addition, because the UHTNs are up to tens of micrometers in length, they can be easily aggregated to form a network. Therefore, a novel paper-like, free-standing UHTN membrane was fabricated
              via
              a simple vacuum filtration method, which also exhibits good adsorption capacity.},

J. regia shell-based activated carbon was used for the adsorption of two synthetic dyes namely, a basic dye malachite green and an acid dye amido black 10B. The prepared adsorbent was crushed and sieved to three different mesh sizes 100, 600 and 1,000 lm. The adsorbent was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, surface acidity and zero-point charge. Batch experiments were carried out by varying the parameters like initial aqueous phase pH, adsorbent dosage and initial dye concentration. The equilibrium data were tested with Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich–Peterson and Sips isotherm at three different temperatures 293, 300 and 313 K and it was found that the Freundlich isotherm best ﬁtted the adsorption of both the dyes. Kinetic data were tested with pseudo ﬁrst-order model and pseudo second-order model. The mechanism for the adsorption of both the dyes onto the adsorbent was studied by ﬁtting the kinetic data with intraparticle diffusion model and Boyd plot. External mass transfer was found to be the rate-determining step. Based on the ionic nature of the adsorbates, the extent of ﬁlm diffusion and intraparticle diffusion varied; both being system speciﬁc. Thermodynamic parameters were also calculated. Finally, the process parameters of each adsorption system were compared to develop the understanding of the best suitable system.},

It was characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray Diffractomer (XRD) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cadmium is one of the toxic metals and has received a great deal of attention. The adsorption of Cd(II) onto HACC–bentonite was examined in aqueous solution with respect to the pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, temperature and initial concentration. Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherms were employed to describe adsorption equilibrium. The maximum amount of Cd(II) adsorbed (qm), as evaluated by Langmuir isotherm, was 22.23 mg per gram of HACC–bentonite at pH 7 0 or so and 20 °C. The Lagergren-ﬁrst-order and pseudo-second-order models were used to describe the kinetic data. The experimental data ﬁtted well the pseudo-second-order kinetics. Furthermore, thermodynamic parameters, free energy (ΔG0), enthalpy (ΔH0) and entropy (ΔS0) of adsorption were also calculated. These parameters showed that the adsorption of Cd(II) onto HACC–bentonite was feasible, spontaneous and an endothermic process in nature. The change of adsorption enthalpy indicated that the adsorption of Cd(II) onto HACC–bentonite may be carried out via cation exchange.},

	abstract = {An analytical approach for estimation of the thermodynamic parameters from the Langmuir isotherm constant has been introduced in the present paper. The concept of the thermodynamic equilibrium constant for the Langmuir isotherm based adsorption process was critically analysed. The study was attributed to the fact that the use of the numerical value of the Langmuir isotherm constant (b) in the van't Hoff equation is supported strictly for the solute concentration presented in mol/L in the non-ionic solution or the dilute solution of ionic species. Otherwise, necessary modiﬁcations of b must be conducted to adopt b as the thermodynamic equilibrium constant. A critical review of some related studies on thermodynamics of adsorption was performed in this paper, which unequivocally demonstrated the improper estimations of the thermodynamic parameters are in practice. The nature of the reaction, spontaneity, etc. is incorrectly appraised in many literature. The present study attempted to represent correct estimations of the thermodynamic parameters appraised by many published literature by the proposed approach and exhibited signiﬁcant deviation from the original works. The inﬂuence of activity on thermodynamic equilibrium constant for few ionic solutions has also been estimated. It may be ascribed to the fact that the activity of the solute on the thermodynamic equilibrium constant has more inﬂuence at the higher concentrations than at the lower concentrations.},

	abstract = {The deﬂuoridation research has thrown up many technologies, with adsorption as a popular alternative, especially among ﬂuoride endemic habitations of the developing world. In the endeavor to develop novel adsorbents for deﬂuoridation, the adsorption potential of hardened alumina cement granules (ALC) were examined through isotherm ﬁtting. Though the adsorbent showed enhanced adsorption capacity at higher ﬂuoride concentration ranges, the errors associated with linearization in isotherm ﬁtting were also found to be increasing. The propagation of these errors was more prominent in Dubinin–Radushkevich and Langmuir models but negligible in Freundlich. The ␹2 analysis, used to correlate the equilibrium experimental data and the isotherm models, also suggested poor correlations at higher ﬂuoride concentration ranges for all the models. The procedure of linear and nonlinear regression through optimization of error functions rendered the ‘best-ﬁt’ model and optimum model parameters, through sum of normalized error (SNE) values. Though ALC exhibited maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 34.36 mg g−1 in concentration variation studies of ﬂuoride in the range of 2.5–100 mg l−1 in synthetic water, it got reduced to 10.215 mg g−1 in dose variation studies and further to 0.9358 mg g−1 in natural ground water. Though Langmuir appeared as the best-ﬁt model in terms of R2 in synthetic studies of different ﬂuoride concentrations, the procedure of linear and nonlinear regression demonstrated that Freundlich was the best-ﬁt. The nonlinear ␹2 analysis together with minimum SNE values convincingly demonstrated that the equilibrium studies with dose variations of ALC offers more reliable isotherm parameters than those with high ﬂuoride concentrations. The sorption of ﬂuoride by ALC appeared endothermic with Freundlich adsorption capacity parameter increased from 0.5589 to 0.9939 l g−1 in natural water and 3.980–7.5198 l g−1 in synthetic water systems for a rise in temperature from 290 to 310 K. The study deviates from conventional methodologies of relying solely on R2 values in selecting ‘best-ﬁt’ isotherm model, and basically demonstrates how the optimum model parameters like ‘adsorption capacity’ evolves through linear and nonlinear regression using error functions.},

Biochar was characterized using proximate analysis, point of zero charge (PZC) analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Equilibrium and kinetic experiments of Cd adsorption on biochar were performed. The results indicated that the pH value at PZC of biochar approached 9.5. Equilibrium can be reached rapidly (within 1 min) in kinetic experiments and a removal rate of 80.6–96.9\% can be generated. The results fitted the pseudo-second-order model closely. The adsorption capacity was estimated using the Langmuir model. The adsorption capacity of Cd on biochar was independent of the pyrolysis temperature and heating time (p{\textgreater}0.01). The maximum adsorption capacity of Cd was 114.69 (mg g−1). The adsorption of Cd on biochar was regarded as chemisorption. The primary adsorption mechanisms were regarded as Cπ–cation interactions and surface precipitation. Cadmium can react with calcite to form the precipitation of (Ca,Cd)CO3 on the surface of biochar. The OP-derived biochar can be considered a favourable alternative and a new green adsorbent for removing Cd2+ ions from an aqueous solution.},

The removal of acid red 183 (AR) and acid green 25 (AG) onto shells of bittim (Pistacia khinjuk Stocks) (BTS) from aqueous solutions was investigated using parameters such as contact time, pH, temperature, adsorbent doses, and initial dye concentration. Adsorption isotherms of dyes onto BTS were determined and correlated with common isotherm equations such as the Langmuir and Freundlich models. Adsorption equilibrium was reached within 30 min. It was found that the Langmuir isotherm appears to fit the isotherm data better than the Freundlich isotherm. Parameters of the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were determined using adsorption data. The maximum adsorption capacities for AR and AG onto BTS at 308, 313, and 318 K were found to be 33, 28, and 20; 16, 18, and 7 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption kinetics of AR and AG could be described by the pseudo-secondorder reaction model.The data obtained from adsorption isotherms at different temperatures were used to calculate several thermo-dynamic quantities such as the Gibbs energy (∆G0), enthalpy (∆H0), and entropy (∆S0) of adsorption. The adsorption process was found to be spontaneous, endothermic and physical in nature. Locally available adsorbent BTS was found to have a low cost and was promising for the removal of AR and AG from aqueous solutions.},

All the linear regression lines of desorption exhibited larger slopes and intercepts than those of adsorption. When the atrazine concentration was high, the slope and intercept values were smaller than those for the desorption regression lines. The results showed that the larger the capacity of a soil to adsorb atrazine, the lesser the amount of atrazine desorbed. For the cultivated soils except for Andiso!s, the percentages of atrazine taken from solutions using the sequential exchange method after the first adsorption experiments, were the same as those desorbed from soils in relation to the initial amount adsorbed.

In the present work, the Temkin adsorption model was applied for evaluation of the thermodynamic parameters of cadmium adsorption studied on sand. The lateral interaction energy parameter was found to be unity, which showed that the heat of adsorption is directly proportional to the fraction of free adsorption sites. The values of Δ H ◦ and Δ S ◦ were –4.8 kJ mol −1 and 42 J mol −1 K −1 , respectively. The value of Δ G ◦ was negative, indicating the spontaneity of cadmium adsorption on sand.},

Although the total sulfur content of jet fuel varies from sample to sample, the individual organosulfur distribution remains unchanged for six jet fuel samples obtained over a 4-year period. The two major sulfur compounds are determined to be 2,3-dimethylbenzothiophene and 2,3,7-trimethylbenzothiophene. These two major compounds are determined to be good representative compounds in jet fuel surrogates for computational studies of jet fuel catalysis such as JP-8 reformation.

The eﬀects of adsorbent particle size, pH, adsorbent dose, contact time and initial dye concentrations on the adsorption of metal complex dyes by pine sawdust was investigated. Acidic pH was favorable for the adsorption of metal complex dyes. A contact time of 120 min was required to reach the equilibrium. The experimental isotherm data were analyzed using the Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin equations. The equilibrium data ﬁt well the Langmuir isotherm. The monolayer adsorption capacities are 280.3 and 398.8 mg dye per g of pine sawdust for Metal Complex Blue and Metal Complex Yellow, respectively. The results indicate that pine sawdust could be employed as low-cost alternative to commercial activated carbon in aqueous solution for the removal of metal complex dyes.},

The adsorption of lead onto NSSCAC has been found to depend on adsorbent dose, initial concentration and contact time. The experiments were carried out at natural solution pH. Equilibrium data fitted well with the Langmuir model and Freundlich model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 23.81 mg of Pb/g of NSSCAC. The experiments showed that the highest removal rate was 92.42\% for Pb2+ under optimal conditions. The sorption of Pb2+ on NSSCAC was rapid during the first 30 min and the equilibrium attained within 60 min. The kinetic processes of Pb2+ adsorption on NSSCAC were described by applying pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. The kinetic data for the adsorption process obeyed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, suggesting that the adsorption process is chemisorption. The NSSCAC investigated in this study showed good potential for the removal of Pb2+ from aqueous solution.},

	abstract = {Calcium carbonate (CaCO3)-enriched biomaterial derived from freshwater mussel shells (FMS) was used as a non-porous biosorbent to explore the characteristics and mechanisms of cadmium adsorption in aqueous solution. The adsorption mechanism was proposed by comparing the FMS properties before and after adsorption alongside various adsorption studies. The FMS biosorbent was characterized using nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and point of zero charge. The results of batch experiments indicated that FMS possessed an excellent affinity to Cd(II) ions within solutions pH higher than 4.0. An increase in ionic strength resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of Cd(II) adsorbed onto FMS. Kinetic study demonstrated that the adsorption process quickly reached equilibrium at approximately 60 min. The FMS biosorbent exhibited the Langmuir maximum adsorption capacity as follows: 18.2 mg/g at 10 °C {\textless} 26.0 mg/g at 30 °C {\textless} 28.6 mg/g at 50 °C. The Cd(II) adsorption process was irreversible, spontaneous (−∆G°), endothermic (+∆H°), and more random (+∆S°). Selective order (mmol/g) of metal cations followed as Pb2+ {\textgreater} Cd2+ {\textgreater} Cu2+ {\textgreater} Cr3+ {\textgreater} Zn2+. For column experiments, the highest Thomas adsorption capacity (7.86 mg/g) was achieved at a flow rate (9 mL/min), initial Cd(II) concentration (10 mg/L), and bed height (5 cm). The Cd(II) removal by FMS was regarded as non-activated chemisorption that occurred very rapidly (even at a low temperature) with a low magnitude of activation energy. Primary adsorption mechanism was surface precipitation. Cadmium precipitated in the primary (Cd,Ca)CO3 form with a calcite-type structure on the FMS surface. A crust of rhombohedral crystals on the substrate was observed by SEM. Freshwater mussel shells have the potential as a renewable adsorbent to remove cadmium from water.},

The applied process of two-stage preparation included pre-treatment through hydrothermal carbonization at 190 ◦C and subsequent pyrolysis at 800 ◦C. Two chemical activating agents (K2CO3 and ZnCl2) were used to prepared activated carbons (K2CO3-AC and ZnCl2-AC), respectively. They were characterized by textural property, morphology, and surface element components and applied to remove Cr(VI) from solution at various solution pH values and initial Cr(VI) concentrations. Results showed that the textural parameters (SBET and VTotal) of the prepared material were 1757 m2/g and 1.027 cm3/g for Zn-Cl2-AC, 1013 m2/g and 0.418 cm3/g for K2CO3-AC, and 792 m2/g and 0.345 cm3/g for biochar. The adsorption process reached the highest eﬃciency at pH 3.0. The Langmuir maximum adsorption capacity indicated the decreasing order: ZnCl2-AC (127 mg/g) {\textgreater} K2CO3-AC (103 mg/g) {\textgreater} biochar (83.5 mg/g). The removal mechanism of Cr(V) from solution was regarded as an adsorption-coupled reduction, namely (1) partial reduction of Cr(VI) into Cr(III) during the adsorption process and (2) adsorption of the Cr(VI) anions through electrostatic attraction and pore ﬁlling and the reduced Cr(III) cations through complexation, Cπ–cation interaction, cation exchange, and pore ﬁling. Therefore, the prepared biochar and activated carbon can server as promising adsorbents to eﬃciently remove both Cr(VI) and Cr(III) from water.},

	abstract = {It is essential for researchers to have an up-to-date understanding of the literature in their research field. However, keeping up with all relevant literature is highly time consuming. Bibliometric visualizations can support this task. These visualizations provide intuitive overviews of the literature in a research field, enabling researchers to obtain a better understanding of the structure and development of a field and to get an impression of the most significant contributions made in the field. In this talk, I will give an introduction to two software tools for bibliometric visualization: VOSviewer (www.vosviewer.com) and CitNetExplorer (www.citnetexplorer.nl). VOSviewer is a popular tool for visualizing bibliometric networks of publications, authors, journals, and keywords. CitNetExplorer is a tool for the visualization and analysis of citation networks of scientific publications. I will pay special attention to applications of VOSviewer and CitNetExplorer in the social sciences and humanities, focusing in particular on the use of advanced text mining, network analysis, and visualization techniques for analyzing large amounts of textual data.

Dr. Nees Jan van Eck is senior researcher at the Centre for Science and
Technology Studies (CWTS) at Leiden University in the Netherlands. He is doing research in the field of bibliometrics and scientometrics. His research focuses on the development of visualization tools and algorithms, mainly for analyzing the structure and development of science. Nees Jan is the main developer of VOSviewer and CitNetExplorer, two well-known software tools for visualizing bibliometric data. The VOSviewer software is frequently used in bibliometric studies. More than 1000 publications have appeared in international scientific journals in which the software is employed. In addition to his work on bibliometric visualization, Nees Jan also focuses on the study of bibliometric data sources and the analysis of the full text of scientific publications. Nees Jan has published more than 50 publications. He is editor brief communications of the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, he serves in the editorial boards of Journal of Data and Information Science and Quantitative Science Studies, and he is an elected board member of the International Society for Informetrics and Scientometrics. Nees Jan has been involved in various commercial bibliometric research projects and training courses in which the VOSviewer software plays a key role. He is also the head of ICT of CWTS, making him responsible for the entire data infrastructure of the center},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jwpe.2020.101877},
	abstract = {This work investigated Cr(VI) adsorption onto pristine and iron modified hydrochar (PSH and PSH-Fe15, respectively) which were generated from paper waste sludge. The results indicate that the hydrothermal carbonization temperature of 200 ◦C was the most suitable for hydrochar production. The batch experiments and the adsorption isotherm and kinetic of Cr(VI) onto PSH and PSH-Fe15 were conducted and used to elucidate the adsorption mechanisms. The results demonstrate that the Cr(VI) adsorption capacity and efficiency onto both PSH and PSH-Fe15 reached equilibrium after 120 min at pH 3 and an initial Cr(VI) concentration of 60 mg/L. In this condition, the adsorption capacities were 5.94 mg/g and 8.67 mg/g and the removal efficiencies were 39.62 \% and 57.80 \% for PSH and PSH-Fe15, respectively. The adsorption processes were well described by the Sips and Redlich–Peterson isotherm models (with R2 of 0.9895, 0.9987 and 0.9947 and 0.9981 for PSH and PSHFe15, respectively) and pseudo-second-order kinetic model (with R2 of 0.98412 and 0.99681, respectively, for PSH and PSH-Fe15). The analysis of characteristics of PSH and PSH-Fe15 indicates the rough and heterogamous surface structures. Moreover, there was presence of iron ions on PSH-Fe15 based on EDS analysis and appearance of oxygen-containing surface functional groups recorded through FTIR results. Finally, it was observed that the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) caused by iron ions on PSM-Fe15’s surface and the presence of O–H groups resulting in the precipitation of Cr(OH)3 on the hydrochar’s surface was the main mechanism of Cr(VI) adsorption onto PSH-Fe15.},

	abstract = {Ammonium is a water pollutant that harms the environment, particularly fisheries. Rice straw is also an economic waste of rice, with millions of tons produced per year around the world. In this paper, physical and chemical procedures for the modification of rice straw were studied. The kinetic and isothermal adsorption trends were investigated, including the ammonium removal efficiency, the contact time of the adsorbent, the amount of adsorbent, and the initial concentration of NH4þ. The effect of temperature and pH on the adsorption process was discussed. The removal efficiency of NH4þ recorded 43, 53.7, and 69.5\%, with maximum adsorption values of 2.9, 3.5, and 4.5 mg/g at temperatures of 25 Æ 5, 35 Æ 5, and 45 Æ 5 C, respectively, at pH 7.5. The biochar obtained from rice follows the pseudo-second-order equation for ammonium adsorption kinetics (R2 ¼ 0.98). The adsorption isotherm follows Freundlich’s model (R2 ¼ 0.99) and Langmuir’s model (R2 ¼ 0.98).},

	abstract = {The recent discovery of bacteria within the genus Nitrospira capable of complete ammonia oxidation (comammox) demonstrated that the sequential oxidation of ammonia to nitrate via nitrite can also be performed within a single bacterial cell. Although comammox Nitrospira exhibit a wide distribution in natural and engineered ecosystems, information on their physiological properties is scarce due to the limited number of cultured representatives. Additionally, most available genomic information is derived from metagenomic sequencing and high-quality genomes of Nitrospira in general are limited. In this study, we obtained a high (90\%) enrichment of a novel comammox species, tentatively named “Candidatus Nitrospira kreftii”, and performed a detailed genomic and physiological characterization. The complete genome of “Ca. N. kreftii” allowed reconstruction of its basic metabolic traits. Similar to Nitrospira inopinata, the enrichment culture exhibited a very high ammonia affinity (Km(app)\_NH3 ≈ 0.040 ± 0.01 µM), but a higher nitrite affinity (Km(app)\_NO2- = 12.5 ± 4.0 µM), indicating an adaptation to highly oligotrophic environments. Furthermore, we observed partial inhibition of ammonia oxidation at ammonium concentrations as low as 25 µM. This inhibition of “Ca. N. kreftii” indicates that differences in ammonium tolerance rather than affinity could potentially be a niche determining factor for different comammox Nitrospira.},

	abstract = {Consistent with the observation that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) outnumber ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in many eutrophic ecosystems globally, AOB typically dominate activated sludge aeration basins from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study, we demonstrate that the growth of AOA strains inoculated into sterile-filtered wastewater was inhibited significantly, in contrast to uninhibited growth of a reference AOB strain. In order to identify possible mechanisms underlying AOA-specific inhibition, we show that complex mixtures of organic compounds, such as yeast extract, were highly inhibitory to all AOA strains but not to the AOB strain. By testing individual organic compounds, we reveal strong inhibitory effects of organic compounds with high metal complexation potentials implying that the inhibitory mechanism for AOA can be explained by the reduced bioavailability of an essential metal. Our results further demonstrate that the inhibitory effect on AOA can be alleviated by copper supplementation, which we observed for pure AOA cultures in a defined medium and for AOA inoculated into nitrifying sludge. Our study offers a novel mechanistic explanation for the relatively low abundance of AOA in most WWTPs and provides a basis for modulating the composition of nitrifying communities in both engineered systems and naturally occurring environments.},

Initial evaluation of DAWC (digested dairy waste biochar) and DWSBC (digested whole sugar beet biochar) showed that both biochars were effective in removing a mixture of four heavy metals (Pb2 +, Cu2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+) from aqueous solutions. Compared to DAWC, DWSBC demonstrated a better ability to remove Ni and Cd. Further investigations of lead sorption by the two biochars indicated that the removal was mainly through a surface precipitation mechanism, which was conﬁrmed by batch sorption experiments, mathematical modeling, and examinations of lead-laden biochars samples using SEM–EDS, XRD, and FTIR. The lead sorption capacity of the two biochars was close to or higher than 200 mmol/kg, which is comparable to that of commercial activated carbons.},

The PZC provides important information about metal sorption mechanisms. Three methods were used: (1) the salt addition method, measuring the PZC; (2) the zeta potential method, measuring the isoelectric point (IEP); (3) the ion adsorption method, measuring the point of zero net charge (PZNC). Natural kaolinite and synthetic goethite were also tested with both the salt addition and the ion adsorption methods in order to validate experimental protocols. Results obtained from the salt addition method in 0.05 M NaNO3 were the following: 4.72 ± 0.06 (maple sawdust), 9.50 ± 0.07 (wood ash), 3.42 ± 0.03 (peat moss), 7.68 ± 0.01 (green compost), and 6.06 ± 0.11 (brown algae). Both the ion adsorption and the zeta potential methods failed to give points of zero charge for these substrates. The PZC of kaolinite (3.01 ± 0.03) was similar to the PZNC (2.9–3.4) and fell within the range of values reported in the literature (2.7–4.1). As for the goethite, the PZC (10.9 ± 0.05) was slightly higher than the PZNC (9.0–9.4). The salt addition method has been found appropriate and convenient to determine the PZC of natural organic substrates.},

There are plenty of studies about application of biochar to adsorb pollutants in wastewater, because of its low-cost preparation, high surface area, large pore volume, plentiful functional groups, and environmental stability. Furthermore, it can be reused due to their high treatment efficiency and resource recovery potential. As biochar can be used for adsorption of typical pollutants in livestock wastewater, it becomes a promising method to treat livestock wastewater. The preparation methods, including pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization, and gasification, were introduced. The applications of biochar to adsorb typical pollutants, such as organic pollutants, heavy metals, and nutrients, in livestock wastewater were present. The organic structures, surface functional groups, surface electricity, and mineral component of biochar were investigated to explain the adsorption mechanism of organic pollutants, heavy metals, and nutrients in wastewater. Finally, outlooks were made for the better use of biochar in future. The relationship of preparation parameters, structures, and adsorption performance of biochar should be discussed. The quantitative analysis for the adsorption of organic structures, surface functional groups, surface electricity, and mineral component should be performed. The disposal of post-sorption biochar should be investigated.},

	abstract = {Municipal and industrial wastewaters contain a wide spectrum of pollutants. Their effective removal presents a challenge for water treatment technology. Biosorption of nutrients and pollutants has been used in sewage treatment since the discovery of the activated sludge process. It is a passive uptake process by which pollutants are adsorbed on the surface of cell walls and/or dissolved in structures of microorganism cells that are present in sludge. Sorbed pollutants remain in the sludge and can be potentially released back into the environment depending on their condition and the reversibility of the pollutant-sludge interaction. An overview of typical biosorption applications for the removal of nutrients, organic pollutants, and metals in wastewater treatment is provided in different areas of their use for the protection of aquatic ecosystems and human health. This book will be of interest to operators of wastewater treatment plants and sludge treatment and disposal facilities as well as to researchers and university students in the field of environmental engineering.},

	abstract = {Industrialization has led to introduction of heavy metals in the environment. Heavy metals are known to persist in the environment and become a risk for organisms. Microorganisms are present in industrial effluents. They have adopted different strategies to cope up with the harmful effects of these metals. These strategies can be metabolism dependent or independent. One such strategy is biosorption which is binding of metal ions with metal binding proteins present on the cell wall. Biosorption is exhibited by bacteria, algae, fungi and yeasts. Not only living organisms, but also residuals of dead bodies of microorganisms shows biosorbent properties like agricultural wastes including husk, seeds, peels and stalks of different crops. Different factors affect the rate of biosorption which includes temperature, pH, nature of biosorbents, surface area to volume ratio, concentration of biomass, initial metal ion concentration and metal affinity to biosorbent. Various models including Freundlich model and Langmuir model can be used to describe biosorption. Recovery of biosorbed metals can be done using agents like thiosulfate, mineral acids and organic acids. Choice of desorption agent should be carefully selected to prevent alteration of physical properties of a biosorbent.},

	abstract = {Fresh water accounts for 3\% of water resources on the Earth. Human and industrial activities produce and discharge wastes containing heavy metals into the water resources making them unavailable and threatening human health and the ecosystem. Conventional methods for the removal of metal ions such as chemical precipitation and membrane filtration are extremely expensive when treating large amounts of water, inefficient at low concentrations of metal (incomplete metal removal) and generate large quantities of sludge and other toxic products that require careful disposal. Biosorption and bioaccumulation are ecofriendly alternatives. These alternative methods have advantages over conventional methods. Abundant natural materials like microbial biomass, agro-wastes, and industrial byproducts have been suggested as potential biosorbents for heavy metal removal due to the presence of metal-binding functional groups. Biosorption is influenced by various process parameters such as pH, temperature, initial concentration of the metal ions, biosorbent dose, and speed of agitation. Also, the biomass can be modified by physical and chemical treatment before use. The process can be made economical by regenerating and reusing the biosorbent after removing the heavy metals. Various bioreactors can be used in biosorption for the removal of metal ions from large volumes of water or effluents. The recent developments and the future scope for biosorption as a wastewater treatment option are discussed.},

Thus, the increased presence of these chalcogen-species in the environment and the contamination of wastewaters nearby processing facilities led to the necessity in developing remediation strategies aimed to detoxify waters, soils and sediments. Among the different decontamination approaches, those based on the ability of microorganisms to bioaccumulate, biomethylate or bioconvert Se- and/or Te-oxyanions are considered the leading strategy for achieving a safe and eco-friendly bioremediation of polluted sites. Recently, several technologies based on the use of bacterial pure cultures, bacterial biofilms or microbial consortia grown in reactors with different configurations have been explored for Se- and Te-decontamination purposes. Further, the majority of microorganisms able to process chalcogen-oxyanions have been described to generate valuable Se- and/or Te-nanomaterials as end-products of their bioconversion, whose potential applications in biomedicine, optoelectronics and environmental engineering are still under investigation. Here, the occurrence, the use and the toxicity of Se- and Te-compounds will be briefly overviewed, while the microbial mechanisms of chalcogen-oxyanions bioprocessing, as well as the microbialbased strategies used for bioremediation approaches will be extensively described.},

In comparison to the unmodiﬁed biochar, the hematite modiﬁed biochar not only had stronger magnetic property but also showed much greater ability to remove As from aqueous solution, likely because the c-Fe2O3 particles on the carbon surface served as sorption sites through electrostatic interactions. Because the magnetized biochar can be easily isolated and removed with external magnets, it can be used in various As contaminant removal applications.},

Meanwhile, the releases of readily soluble NH4+, NO3À and PO43À from biochars and the adsorption of NH4+, NO3À and PO43À by biochars were investigated. Results indicated that the involvement of LaCl3 in pyrolysis could advance the temperature of maximum mass loss by 10 °C compared with oak sawdust (CK), and potentially promoted biochar yield. Overall, the releases of readily soluble NH4+, NO3À and PO43À from biochars were negatively related to pyrolysis temperature, and the releases were greatly weakened by La-biochars. Additionally, the adsorption to NH4+ can be promoted by the biochars produced at low temperature. On the contrary, the NO3À adsorption can be improved by increasing pyrolysis temperature. The highest PO43À adsorption was achieved by the biochars produced at 500 °C. According to the results of adsorption isotherms, the maximum adsorption capacity of NH4+, NO3À and PO43À can be significantly promoted by 1.9, 11.2, and 4.5 folds using La-biochars. Based on the observations of FT-IR, SEM–EDS, and surface functional groups, the improvement of NH4+ adsorption was potentially associated with the existing acidic function groups (phenolic-OH and carboxyl C@O). The increased basic functional groups on La-biochars were beneﬁcial to improve NO3À and PO43À adsorption. Besides, PO43À adsorption was also potentially related to the formed La2O3.},

This study focuses on the development of a low cost adsorbent, speciﬁcally a modiﬁed biochar prepared from corncob. Evaluated here is the efﬁciency of this new material for removing ammonium from synthetic water (ammonium concentration from 10 to 100 mg/L). The characteristics of the modiﬁed biochar were determined by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) test, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that ammonium adsorption on modiﬁed biochar strongly depended on pH. Adsorption kinetics of NH4+-N using modiﬁed biochar followed the pseudo-second order kinetic model. Both Langmuir and Sips adsorption isotherm models could simulate well the adsorption behavior of ammonium on modiﬁcated biochar. The highest adsorption capacity of 22.6 mg NH4+-N/g modiﬁed biochar was obtained when the biochar was modiﬁed by soaking it in HNO3 6 M and NaOH 0.3 M for 8 h and 24 h, respectively. The high adsorption capacity of the modiﬁed biochar suggested that it is a promising adsorbent for NH4+-N remediation from water.},

Adsorption experiments with RHC indicated phosphate and nitrate adsorption of 65\% and 75\% respectively. The adsorption kinetics indicated pseudo-second-order adsorption model for adsorption of nutrients on biochar with an R2 value more than 0.98. In addition, the Langmuir-Freundlich isotherm was observed to represent the adsorption of phosphate on RHC, whereas adsorption data of nitrate depicted Langmuir isotherm followed by Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms. The maximum phosphate and nitrate adsorption capacity were 71 mg/kg and 497 mg/kg respectively using Langmuir isotherm model. The desorption study indicated a release of 96.6\% and 44.4\% of adsorbed phosphate and nitrate, respectively. Hence, from 1 kg of nutrient loaded RHC about 68 mg of phosphate and 220 mg of nitrate can be extracted for land application.},

	abstract = {Growing demand for efficient wastewater treatment systems is spurring on the development of new technologies. Biofilm-based reactors can be used for the treatment of a variety of wastewaters and these reactors are resistant to toxic environments. Bioreactors, such as sequencing batch biofilm and moving bed biofilm are advanced techniques to treat various types of wastewaters with diverse operating conditions. Ammonium oxidizing bacteria, nitrite oxidizing bacteria and Anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation) bacteria are reported to be responsible for nutrient removal. In recent decades, the performance of these systems has been studied widely and compared for a number of wastewater treatment applications. In general, they are particularly suitable for high-rate nitrification and nitrogen removal. The efficiency of these reactors has been confirmed in the laboratory and large-scale plants. Their efficiency depends on the surface area of the biocarrier, the filling percentage volume of biofilm carriers, organic loading and diffused aeration supply. Chemical oxygen demand removal of 50–98\% was reported for {\textless}12 h hydraulic retention time, 0.2 to 6.5 mg L−1 dissolved oxygen concentration and temperature range 15–35 °C. Also, the ratio of nitrate to ammonium conversion was from 0.2 to 90 and N2 conversion was from 0 to 8.5 mg. This review studied each of these bioreactors in the removal of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and oxygen) from different wastewaters and compared them to conventional treatment. The review also includes the relevant studies on laboratory and pilot-scale bioreactors to enhance their performance and reduce their costs. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry},

This review evaluates various methods to increase the sorption efficiency of biochar including activation with steam, acids and bases and the production of biochar-based composites with metal oxides, carbonaceous materials, clays, organic compounds, and biofilms. We describe the approaches, and explain how each modification alters the sorption capacity. Physical and chemical activation enhances the surface area or functionality of biochar, whereas modification to produce biochar-based composites uses the biochar as a scaffold to embed new materials to create surfaces with novel surface properties upon which inorganic pollutants can sorb. Many of these approaches enhanced the retention of a wide range of inorganic pollutants in waters, but here we provide a comparative assessment for Cd2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, NH4+, NO3-, PO43-, CrO42- and AsO43-.},

Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) simulators are used by consulting engineers and WWTP operators when planning, designing, optimizing, and evaluating the unit processes that comprise municipal and industrial WWTPs. Many WWTP simulators have been expanded to include a submerged completely-mixed biofilm reactor module that is based on the mathematical description of a one-dimensional biofilm. Leading consultants, equipment manufacturers, and WWTP modelling software developers have made meaningful contributions to advancing the use of biofilm models in engineering practice, but the bulk of the engineering community either does not use the now readily available biofilm reactor modules or utilizes them as ‘black-box’ design tools. The latter approach results in the mathematical biofilm models being no more useful than the empirical design criteria and formulations that have been historically applied to biofilm reactor design. The present work provides a consensus report on the state-of-the art, areas of uncertainty, and future needs for advancing the use of biofilm models in engineering design.},

	abstract = {Biochar as a stable carbon-rich material shows incredible potential to handle water/wastewater contaminants. Its application is gaining increasing interest due to the availability of feedstock, the simplicity of the preparation methods, and their enhanced physico-chemical properties. The eﬃcacy of biochar to remove organic and inorganic pollutants depends on its surface area, pore size distribution, surface functional groups, and the size of the molecules to be removed, while the physical architecture and surface properties of biochar depend on the nature of feedstock and the preparation method/conditions. For instance, pyrolysis at high temperatures generally produces hydrophobic biochars with higher surface area and micropore volume, allowing it to be more suitable for organic contaminants sorption, whereas biochars produced at low temperatures own smaller pore size, lower surface area, and higher oxygen-containing functional groups and are more suitable to remove inorganic contaminants. In the ﬁeld of water/wastewater treatment, biochar can have extensive application prospects. Biochar have been widely used as an additive/support media during anaerobic digestion and as ﬁlter media for the removal of suspended matter, heavy metals and pathogens. Biochar was also tested for its eﬃciency as a support-based catalyst for the degradation of dyes and recalcitrant contaminants. The current review discusses on the diﬀerent methods for biochar production and provides an overview of current applications of biochar in wastewater treatment.},

	abstract = {The treatment of high-strength anaerobic digester efﬂuent in laboratory-scale trickling ﬁlters for nitriﬁcation and then anaerobic ﬁlters for denitriﬁcation is reported. Five media types were investigated in the trickling ﬁlters: biochar, granular activated carbon (GAC), zeolite, Pall rings, and gravel. Three media were tested in ﬁve denitrifying ﬁlters: sand (S), bamboo wood chips (B), eucalyptus wood chips (E), bamboo with sand (BþS), and eucalyptus with sand (EþS). The different wood chips served as a supplemental electron donor for denitriﬁcation. From six months of operation, biochar, GAC, zeolite, Pall rings, and gravel media had turbidity (NTU) removal efﬁciencies of 90, 91, 77, 74, and 74\%, respectively, and ammonia removal efﬁciencies of 83, 87, 85, 30, and 80\%, respectively, which was primarily by nitriﬁcation to nitrate. For the anaerobic ﬁlters, S, B, BþS, E, and EþS had nitrate removal efﬁciencies of 30, 66, 53, 35, and 35\%, and turbidity removal efﬁciencies of 88, 89, 84, 89, and 88\%, respectively. Biochar and bamboo were selected as the best combination of media for trickling ﬁlter and anaerobic ﬁlter sequential treatment. Based on an average initial inﬂuent of 600 mg NH3-N LÀ1, 50 mg NO3-N LÀ1, and 980 NTU, the biochar ﬁlter's efﬂuent would be 97 mg NH3-N LÀ1, 475 mg NO3-N LÀ1, and 120 NTU. The bamboo ﬁlter's ﬁnal efﬂuent would be 82 mg NH3-N LÀ1, 157 mg NO3-N LÀ1, and 13 NTU, which corresponds to 63\% removal of total N and 99\% removal of turbidity. These ﬁlter media thus present a simple option for sustainable post-treatment for nitrogen management and efﬂuent polishing in low-resources settings.},

	abstract = {Biochar, derived from thermal pyrolysis of biomass, has been regarded as a low-cost, sustainable and beneficial material and widely applied in agriculture, environment and energy during the last two decades. To elucidate the research status timely and future trends in biochar field, CiteSpace is used to systematically analyze the related literature retrieved from the Web of Science core collection in 2019. Based on the keywords clustering analysis, it was found that “biochar production”, “organic pollutants removal”, “heavy metals immobilization”, “bioremediation” were the main hotspots in research covering biochar. “Bioremediation” is an emerging topic and deserves extensive attention due to its highly effective and environmentally friendly treatment of pollutants. Improving the phytoremediation effect, immobilizing functional microorganisms on biochar, and using microorganisms as raw materials to produce biochar were the common methods of biochar-assisted bioremediation. While studies focused on “soil quality and plant growth” and “biochar and global climate change” decreased, investigations concentrated in the toxicity of biochar to soil biota and ruminants are sustainably growing. Research on direct and catalytic thermal pyrolysis of green waste (mainly microalgae) for biofuels (bio-oil, biodiesel, syngas, etc.) and biochar production is increasing. Converting municipal wastes (e.g., sewage sludge, fallen leaves) into biochar through pyrolysis was a suitable treatment for municipal waste and became a popular topic in recent time. Moreover, the biochar produced from these municipal wastes exhibited excellent performance in the removal of pollutants from wastewater and soil. This review may help to identify future directions in biochar research and applications.},

	abstract = {Many organic compounds of environmental concern contain amine groups that are positively charged at environmental pH. Here we present evidence that (hetero)aromatic amine cations can act as π acceptors in forming π+−π electron donor−acceptor (EDA) interactions with the π electron-rich, polyaromatic surface of pyrogenic carbonaceous materials (PCMs) (i.e., biochar, black carbon, and graphene). The π+−π EDA interactions combine a cation−π force with a π−π EDA force resulting from charge polarization of the ring’s quadrupole. Adsorption on a biochar and reference adsorbent graphite was conducted of triazine herbicides, substituted anilines, heterocyclic aromatic amines, and other amines whose charge is insulated from the aromatic ring. When normalized for the hydrophobic eﬀect, the adsorption increased with decreasing pH as the amines became ionized, even on graphite that had no signiﬁcant ﬁxed or variable charge. The cationic π acceptor (quinolinium ion) was competitively displaced more eﬀectively by the π acceptor 2,4-dinitrobenzene than by the π donor naphthalene. The maximum electrostatic potential of organocations computed with density functional theory was found to be a strong predictor of the π+−π EDA interaction. The π+−π EDA interaction was disfavored by electropositive alkyl substituents and by charge delocalization into additional rings. Amines whose charge was insulated from the ring fell far out of the correlation (more positive free energy of adsorption). Identifying and characterizing this novel π+−π EDA interaction on PCMs will help in predicting the fate of organocations in both natural and engineered systems.},

	abstract = {The pEDA parameter (pi electron donor-acceptor) is a pi-electron substituent effect scale, described also as mesomeric or resonance effect. There is also a complementary scale - sEDA. The more positive is the value of pEDA the more pi-electron donating is a substituent. The more negative pEDA, the more pi-electron withdrawing is the substituent (see the table below).
The pEDA parameter for a given substituent is calculated by means of quantum chemistry methods. The model molecule is the monosubstituted benzene. First the geometry should be optimized at a suitable model of theory, then the natural population analysis within the framework of Natural Bond Orbital theory is performed. The molecule have to be oriented in such a way that the aromatic benzene ring is perpendicular to the z-axis. Then, the 2pz orbital occupations of ring carbon atoms are summed up to give the total pi- occupation. From this value the sum of pi-occupation for unsubstituted benzene (value close to 6 in accord to Huckel rule) is subtracted resulting in original pEDA parameter. For pi-electron donating substituents like -NH2, OH or -F the pEDA parameter is positive, and for pi-electron withdrawing substituents like -NO2, -BH2 or -CN the pEDA is negative.
The pEDA scale was invented by Wojciech P. Oziminski and Jan Cz. Dobrowolski and the details are available in the original paper.The pEDA scale linearly correlates with experimental substituent constants like Taft-Topsom σR parameter.For easy calculation of pEDA the free of charge for academic purposes written in Tcl program with Graphical User Interface AromaTcl is available.
Sums of pi-electron occupations and pEDA parameter for substituents of various character are gathered in the following table:},

	abstract = {Quy tắc Klechkovsky (còn viết là Klechkowski), có tên khác là quy tắc Madelung hay nguyên lý vững bền (tiếng Anhː aufbau principle hay building-up principle) phát biểu rằng ở trạng thái cơ bản của nguyên tử hoặc ion, các electron lấp đầy orbital nguyên tử ở mức năng lượng từ thấp đến cao. Ví dụ, electron sẽ chiếm phân lớp 1s trước phân lớp 2s. Theo cách này, các electron của nguyên tử hoặc ion tạo thành cấu hình electron ổn định nhất có thể. Một ví dụ là cấu hình 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p3 cho nguyên tử phốtpho, nghĩa là phân lớp 1s có 2 electron, phân lớp 2s có 2 electron... Quy tắc này được đề xuất bởi nhiều nhà hóa học, mà sau đó được gọi theo tên của Vsevolod Klechkovsky trong các tài liệu tiếng Việt.
Tính chất chiếm mức năng lượng của electron được xây dựng bởi các nguyên tắc khác của vật lý nguyên tử, như quy tắc Hund và nguyên lý loại trừ Pauli. Quy tắc Hund phát biểu rằng nếu có nhiều orbital cùng mức năng lượng, các electron sẽ chiếm các orbital khác nhau sao cho số electron độc thân là tối đa và các electron độc thân phải có spin cùng dấu. Khi các electron bắt cặp nhau, nguyên lý Pauli cho thấy các electron cùng orbital phải có spin khác nhau (+1/2 và −1/2).
Khi chúng ta đi từ nguyên tố này sang nguyên tố khác có số hiệu nguyên tử cao hơn liền kề, số proton và số electron của nguyên tử tăng thêm 1. Số electron tối đa trong bất kỳ lớp nào là 2n2, trong đó n là số lượng tử chính. Số electron tối đa trong một phân lớp (s, p, d hoặc f) bằng 2(2ℓ + 1) trong đó ℓ = 0, 1, 2, 3... Do đó, các phân lớp này có thể có tối đa là 2, 6, 10 và 14 electron tương ứng. Ở trạng thái cơ bản, cấu hình electron được thiết lập bằng cách đặt các electron vào các phân lớp có mức năng lượng thấp nhất cho đến khi tổng số electron bằng với số hiệu nguyên tử. Các orbital nguyên tử được điền theo thứ tự năng lượng tăng dần, sử dụng hai quy tắc chung để giúp dự đoán cấu hình electron:

1. Các electron được gán cho các orbital theo thứ tự giá trị tăng dần của (n + ℓ).
2. Đối với các phân lớp có cùng giá trị (n + ℓ), các electron được gán trước cho phân lớp có n nhỏ hơn.Một phiên bản của quy tắc Klechkovsky là mô hình vỏ hạt nhân (nuclear shell modell) được sử dụng để dự đoán cấu hình của các proton và neutron trong hạt nhân nguyên tử.},

The ﬁlter system was seeded with microbial consortia from the freshwater sediment with a history of exposure to fertilizer runoff. For test purposes, the BTF was fed with simulated wastewater and operated under variable aerobic and anaerobic conditions using various carbon sources and loading conditions. Start-up and operation characteristics including hydraulic retention time (HRT), carbon sources and reactor column depths on pollutants removal were studied. The BTF began working well after one month of operation and thereafter provided effective treatment. Optimal operation parameters utilized an HRT of 36–48 h, using bicarbonate as carbon source, and palm biochar chips as the packing material. Sequential aerobic nitriﬁcation and anaerobic denitriﬁcation were obtained with NH4+-N and TP/NOx-N being removed in Reactor A and Reactor B, respectively. The results showed that the two-phase BTF system was efﬁcient for treating wastewater with high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus: Under optimum conditions, removal of approximately 80\% of ammonium and 68\% of total phosphorus was achieved, resulting in the formation of efﬂuent suitable for recycling or release into natural waters. The study provides invaluable insight for further design and operation of full-scale wastewater treatment system.},

Five tests were conducted with stormwater collected from a nearby industrial site, and influent and effluent were analyzed for copper, zinc, total nitrogen, nitrate, ammonia, total phosphorus, and phosphate. The results show that copper and zinc removal was inconsistent in the mixed and layered setups. Removal varied significantly between tests and did not appear to be impacted by biochar. Nutrient removal was also inconsistent, with varying removal rates between tests for the control and biochar planters. Layering of bioretention soil components appeared to slightly improve removal during some of the tests, but differences were not statistically significant over all 5 tests. This study showed that removal of stormwater contaminants in bioretention systems did not significantly improve with the addition of biochar.},

Biochars produced from cellulose, corn stover and wood feedstocks had signiﬁcant low-pKa organic structural (0.03e0.34 meq gÀ1), other organic (0e0.92 meq gÀ1), carbonate (0.02e1.5 meq gÀ1), and other inorganic (0e0.26 meq gÀ1) alkalinities. All four categories of biochar alkalinity contributed to total biochar alkalinity and are therefore relevant to pH-sensitive soil processes. Total biochar alkalinity was strongly correlated with base cation concentration, but biochar alkalinity was not a simple function of elemental composition, soluble ash, ﬁxed carbon, or volatile matter content. More research is needed to characterize soluble biochar alkalis other than carbonates and to establish predictive relationships among biochar production parameters and the composition of biochar alkalis.},

	abstract = {Azanes  are acyclic, saturated hydronitrogens, which means that they consist only of hydrogen and nitrogen atoms and all bonds are single bonds. They are therefore pnictogen hydrides. Because cyclic hydronitrogens are excluded by definition, the azanes comprise a homologous series of inorganic compounds with the general chemical formula NnHn+2. 
Each nitrogen atom has three bonds (either N-H or N-N bonds), and each hydrogen atom is joined to a nitrogen atom (H-N bonds). A series of linked nitrogen atoms is known as the nitrogen skeleton or nitrogen backbone. The number of nitrogen atoms is used to define the size of the azane (e.g. N2-azane).
The simplest possible azane (the parent molecule) is ammonia, NH3. There is no limit to the number of nitrogen atoms that can be linked together, the only limitation being that the molecule is acyclic, is saturated, and is a hydronitrogen.
Azanes are reactive and have significant biological activity. Azanes can be viewed as a more biologically active or reactive portion (functional groups) of the molecule, which can be hung upon molecular trees.},

            Prefil Footprinter, a portable pressure filtration instrument, is usually employed to detect liquid metal quality. However, no investigations have ever been done to determine overall filtration resistance and resistance of the “clean” filter media. Based on the identification of flow behaviour using the derivative methods, classic filtration equations have been effectively used to estimate total filtration resistance for the first time. The variations of overall resistance during filtration provide a new approach to understand filtration behaviour. The resistance values of the “clean” filter media have been obtained for the first time. An innovative method has been developed to obtain the resistance of the “clean” filter media through the backward extrapolation of the overall filtration resistance versus filtrate weight or filtration time curves over the steady stages operating in incompressible cake mode.},

Four biochar samples were produced and subjected to batch sorption experiment. Data obtained were fitted into the linear forms of four adsorption isotherm and kinetics models. Least square regression analysis was used to test the best fitting isotherm and kinetic model using the coefficient of determination (R2). Results revealed that only maize cob biochar (MCB) and poultry litter biochar (PLB) had the ability to adsorb nitrate with maximum quantities of adsorbed nitrate (73.915 and 133.887 mgg-1). Similarly, adsorption kinetics indicated better fitting of the adsorption data onto the linear form of the pseudo second order kinetics (PSOK) model. Lower R2 values recorded by the intra particle diffusion and Elovich adsorption kinetic models suggest that the adsorption process was physical and intra- particle diffusion was not the rate controlling step. Similarly, 99\% change in nitrate adsorption was accounted by the combined influence of biochar electrical conductivity (EC), zero point of charge (ZPC) and pH. Hence, modification of biochar EC, ZPC and pH are necessary for using biochar to successfully remove nitrate from polluted environments.},

            To develop low-cost adsorbents for aqueous nitrate, biochars were prepared from three types of agricultural residuals at different pyrolysis temperatures (300 °C, 450 °C, and 600 °C). The corncob biochar produced at 600 °C (CC600) was the best nitrate adsorbent of all the tested biochars. Characterization results showed that CC600 had good thermal stability, porous structure, and abundant surface functional groups. Findings from batch adsorption experiments demonstrated that CC600 showed relatively fast adsorption kinetics to nitrate in aqueous solutions. In addition, the Langmuir adsorption capacity of CC600 to nitrate was 14.46 mg/g, comparable to that of other biochar-based adsorbents. Therefore, CC600 showed promising potential to be used as a low-cost adsorbent for the treatment of nitrate in water.},

Concessions had to be made, especially for the use in vacuum or pressure filtration. Design and characteristics of the filter media, such as number of pores, pore shape, pore size, pore size distribution and permeability, are all influencing the cake formation, cake filtration, filter media lifetime, as well as the resulting machine efficiency and productivity – in the end: the overall cost of ownership.},

The appropriate pore size of filter medium for filtration was analysed. The resistances of filter media measured with thick suspensions by Ruth's equation have negative values.

The objective of this work was to investigate the effects provoked by three different filtering media on the performance of that equipment. Within the limits of the region investigated — pressure drops in the range 88260–205940 N my2 — these filtering hydrocyclones were compared to the conventional Bradley’s hydrocyclone and displayed increases in both feed flowrates and reduced cut sizes. A dependence of the underflow-to-throughput ratios on the filtering medium resistance was also registered. Based on the experimental results, an explanatory mechanism for the phenomena observed as well as design equations accounting for the influence of the filtering medium resistance have been proposed, allowing the prediction of the performance of filtering hydrocyclones and providing a new alternative in terms of solid–liquid separation devices. q 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

Rice husk charcoal was employed to investigate adsorption of ammonium in simulated waste water, using once balance method. It is found that ammonium nitrogen in water can be rapidly adsorbed by rice husk charcoal in 2 min with maximum sorption capacity of 2.6 mg/g (Langmuir isotherm adsorption model). The n value of 1.2 in Freundlich isotherm model indicates that the absorbent is very suitable for rapid removal of ammonium from water. In addition, quasi-second order kinetic equation is well suited to describe ammonium absorption with time (P{\textless}0.01). The adsorption mechanism is supposed that rice husk charcoal firstly imbibes in water and much swells, and then ammonium ion diffuses into the micro pore structure and redistributes upon a steady state.},

	abstract = {Growing demand for eﬃcient wastewater treatment systems is spurring on the development of new technologies. Bioﬁlm-based reactors can be used for the treatment of a variety of wastewaters and these reactors are resistant to toxic environments. Bioreactors, such as sequencing batch bioﬁlm and moving bed bioﬁlm are advanced techniques to treat various types of wastewaters with diverse operating conditions. Ammonium oxidizing bacteria, nitrite oxidizing bacteria and Anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation) bacteria are reported to be responsible for nutrient removal. In recent decades, the performance of these systems has been studied widely and compared for a number of wastewater treatment applications. In general, they are particularly suitable for high-rate nitriﬁcation and nitrogen removal. The eﬃciency of these reactors has been conﬁrmed in the laboratory and large-scale plants. Their eﬃciency depends on the surface area of the biocarrier, the ﬁlling percentage volume of bioﬁlm carriers, organic loading and diﬀused aeration supply. Chemical oxygen demand removal of 50–98\% was reported for {\textless}12 h hydraulic retention time, 0.2 to 6.5 mg L−1 dissolved oxygen concentration and temperature range 15–35 ∘C. Also, the ratio of nitrate to ammonium conversion was from 0.2 to 90 and N2 conversion was from 0 to 8.5 mg. This review studied each of these bioreactors in the removal of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and oxygen) from diﬀerent wastewaters and compared them to conventional treatment. The review also includes the relevant studies on laboratory and pilot-scale bioreactors to enhance their performance and reduce their costs.},

	abstract = {Biochar (BC), a carbon-rich solid product of biomass, and its surface activation via steam have been recognized as alternative economically viable strategy to decontaminate wastewaters. Existence of glyphosate, the most extensively used non-selective herbicide, in waters at elevated concentrations has received worldwide attention due to its ill consequences. The main objective of the present study was to investigate the potential of steam activated BC produced from rice husk (RHBC) via slow pyrolysis at 700 C to remove glyphosate from aqueous solution. Batch adsorption experiments were carried out to evaluate the effects of pH, reaction time and glyphosate loading on the RHBC adsorption process. Results showed that a maximum removal of glyphosate (82.0\%) occurred at pH 4, and the adsorption capacity decreased signiﬁcantly with increasing pH. Both the Freundlich and Langmuir models ﬁtted best to the equilibrium isotherm data suggesting physisorption as well as chemisorption mechanisms governing the glyphosate adsorption. The Langmuir maximum adsorption capacity was 123.03 mg/g. The kinetics of the adsorption process was well described by the pseudo-ﬁrst order indicating that the glyphosate adsorption onto RHBC would be more inclined towards physisorption depending on the initial glyphosate concentration. Pore diffusion, pep electron donoreacceptor interaction and H-bonding were postulated to be involved in physisorption, whereas electrophilic interactions led to chemisorption type of adsorption. Overall, steam activated RHBC could be a promising remedy of glyphosate removal from aqueous solution.},

Characterization experiments with FTIR and XPS suggested that the novel modiﬁed biochar had more surface functional groups compare to the pristine biochar. Adsorption experiments indicated that the initial pH of the solution inﬂuenced the ability of biochars to adsorb heavy metals in single- and multi-metal systems. Moreover, the chitosan-PMDA modiﬁed biochar had strong selective adsorption of Cu(II). Mechanism studies showed that chemisorption was the major mechanism for heavy metal removal by the chitosan-PMDA modiﬁed biochar. Furthermore, the types of effective functional group for these heavy metal removal were different. The NAC@O group played a dominant role in the process of Pb(II) removal, while several N-containing functional groups and C@C groups participated in the adsorption of Cd(II). The novel engineered biochar had selective adsorption capacity for copper due to the N-containing functional groups, meanwhile abundant carbonyl groups also participated in the removal of copper, and may reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I).},

	abstract = {Biochar is a stable carbon-rich by-product synthesized through pyrolysis/carbonization of plant- and animal-based biomass. An increasing interest in the beneﬁcial application of biochar has opened up multidisciplinary areas for science and engineering. The potential biochar applications include carbon sequestration, soil fertility improvement, pollution remediation, and agricultural by-product/waste recycling. The key parameters controlling its properties include pyrolysis temperature, residence time, heat transfer rate, and feedstock type. The efﬁcacy of biochar in contaminant management depends on its surface area, pore size distribution and ion-exchange capacity. Physical architecture and molecular composition of biochar could be critical for practical application to soil and water. Relatively high pyrolysis temperatures generally produce biochars that are effective in the sorption of organic contaminants by increasing surface area, microporosity, and hydrophobicity; whereas the biochars obtained at low temperatures are more suitable for removing inorganic/polar organic contaminants by oxygen-containing functional groups, electrostatic attraction, and precipitation. However, due to complexity of soil–water system in nature, the effectiveness of biochars on remediation of various organic/inorganic contaminants is still uncertain. In this review, a succinct overview of current biochar use as a sorbent for contaminant management in soil and water is summarized and discussed.},

	abstract = {The 2020 edition of The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture has a particular focus on sustainability. This reflects a number of specific considerations. First, 2020 marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (the Code). Second, several Sustainable Development Goal indicators mature in 2020. Third, FAO hosted the International Symposium on Fisheries Sustainability in late 2019, and fourth, 2020 sees the finalization of specific FAO guidelines on sustainable aquaculture growth, and on social sustainability along value chains. 

While Part 1 retains the format of previous editions, the structure of the rest of the publication has been revised. Part 2 opens with a special section marking the twenty fifth anniversary of the Code. It also focuses on issues coming to the fore, in particular, those related to Sustainable Development Goal 14 and its indicators for which FAO is the “custodian” agency. In addition, Part 2 covers various aspects of fisheries and aquaculture sustainability. The topics discussed range widely, from data and information systems to ocean pollution, product legality, user rights and climate change adaptation. Part 3 now forms the final part of the publication, covering projections and emerging issues such as new technologies and aquaculture biosecurity. It concludes by outlining steps towards a new vision for capture fisheries. The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture aims to provide objective, reliable and up-to-date information to a wide audience – policymakers, managers, scientists, stakeholders and indeed everyone interested in the fisheries and aquaculture sector.

Analytical criteria such as accuracy, repeatability, precision, and robustness are applied. Oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are used as the model substance. Different reaction bases (NaHCO3(aq), Na2CO3(aq), NaOH(aq)) are applied and treatment times are studied. We also show that smaller amounts of carbon material can be reliably analyzed by using an autotitrator combined with a pH electrode. We ﬁnd that indirect titration with Na2CO3 results in the highest titration precision and accuracy despite the lower base strength compared with NaOH. Therefore, CO2 impurities do not have to be removed and only 7 min is necessary for one titration. The titration error with respect to the proposed method is 0.15\% of the aliquot volume. The mixing method during the carbon treatment with bases (stirring, shaking, ultrasound treatment) has no inﬂuence on the result as long as one allows a few hours for the reaction to complete. Finally, we provide a standard operating procedure for obtaining results with high precision during Boehm titration.},

	abstract = {Pine wood biochar, prepared at 698 K with a residence time of 20–30 s in an auger-fed reactor, was used as a 3-dimensional adsorbent to remove salicylic acid and ibuprofen from aqueous solutions. This biochar was characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, surface area determination, and zero point charge measurements. Batch sorption studies were carried out at pH values from 2 to 10, adsorbate concentrations from 25 to 100 mg/L and temperatures from 298 to 318 K. The adsorption of both adsorbates was highest at low pH values, dropped as pH increased and then exhibited a second increase related to the pKa of these carboxylic acid adsorbates. This was followed by a further drop at high pH. Conjugate acid/base equilibria of the adsorbates and the phenolic hydroxyl and carboxylic acid biochar sites versus pH dominated the mechanism. Sorption followed pseudo-second order kinetics. Sorption was evaluated from 298 to 318 K using the Freundlich, Langmuir, Redlich–Peterson, Toth, Sips, and Radke–Prausnitz adsorption isotherm models. Langmuir adsorption capacities for both salicylic acid and ibuprofen were 22.70 and 10.74 mg/g, respectively. This low surface area pinewood biochar (1.35 m2/g) can adsorb far more adsorbate compared to commercial activated carbons per unit of measured surface area. Methanol stripping achieved 93\% and 88\% desorption of salicylic acid and ibuprofen, respectively, from the spent biochar, and 76\% and 72\% of the initial salicylic acid and ibuprofen adsorption capacity, respectively, remained after four full capacity equilibrium recycles.},

The results of Diffusive Reflection Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy were statistically analyzed with multiple linear regression techniques and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with the biochar characterization pa­ rameters as model inputs. The dominant parameters affecting the functional group signals were the pyrolysis temperature, the H/C-ratio and specific surface area of the biochar and the ash fraction. Regression models were able to explain 60–90\% of data variance for specific peaks in the DRIFTS-spectra. The application of PCA could further reduce the input parameters to three main factors explaining 70.8\% of total data variance. Biplots of the first two main factors showed the similarity of infrared spectra of biochars produced at 300 and 450 ◦C, whereas a pyrolysis temperature of 600 ◦C lead to a partial and a 750 ◦C to a nearly complete loss of biochar surface functional groups.},

In this work, a series of biochars were produced from empty fruit bunch (EFB) and rice husk (RH) by slow pyrolysis at different temperatures (350, 500, and 650°C) and their physicochemical properties were analysed. The results indicate that porosity, ash content, electrical conductivity (EC), and pH value of both EFB and RH biochars were increased with temperature; however, yield, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and H, C, and N content were decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature. The Fourier transform IR spectra were similar for both RH and EFB biochars but the functional groups were more distinct in the EFB biochar spectra. There were reductions in the amount of functional groups as pyrolysis temperature increased especially for the EFB biochar. However, total acidity of the functional groups increased with pyrolysis temperature for both biochars.},

	abstract = {Greenhouse production can contribute to the accumulation of salt and heavy metals and nutrient imbalance, thus, increasingly degrading greenhouse soils. The potential of rice husk biochar to increase carbon sequestration, neutralize soil pH, increase nutrient retention, and change nutrient/heavy metal sorption/desorption in greenhouse soils is promising. Therefore, we investigated three greenhouse soils (red soil) with 3, 14, and 24 cultivation years (3S, 14S, and 24S) in northern Taiwan to test the eﬀects of rice husk biochar (RHB) on carbon dynamics and nutrient availability. A 100-day incubation study was conducted in which poultry-livestock manure compost (2\% by wt.) and six rice-husk-based, slow-pyrolysis biochars pyrolyzed at diﬀerent temperatures were applied (0\%, 0.5\%, 1.0\%, 4.0\%, 10\%, and 20\% by wt.) to three red soils. The study results indicated that the RHB pyrolyzed at high temperatures, with relatively high pH and Ca content, could lead to a higher neutralizing eﬀect when applied to the soil. In addition, the high temperatures pyrolyzed RHB had a higher capacity to reduce the concentration of Cu, Pb, and Zn in the three soils, especially for the younger cultivation soil, which contributed to the higher pH and relatively high surface area of these RHB, and the relative lower soil pH of the younger soil. Furthermore, only adding 0.5\% RHB could result in an evident change in soil characteristics for 3S and 24S soil, including cumulative C release, pH, EC, TC, and available K increase, but 4\% RHB addition was needed for 14S soil. In the condition of co-application with 2\% compost (by wt.), 4\% RHB addition was necessary for carbon sequestration, at least 10\% RHB addition was needed for 3S and 14S soil, but 1.0 to 4.0\% would be suﬃcient for 24S. In conclusion, the RHB and compost co-application in greenhouse soil resulted in improved chemical properties, and the eﬀect of the pyrolysis temperature, application rate, and cultivation age had varying improvements.},

Extensive space technology experience in the design of CBLSSes, which simultaneously produce food, water, nutrients, and fertilizers, process wastes, and revitalize air, has been analyzed and systematized with application to hot deserts, which represent extreme habitats with high input of solar energy, poor organic life, and nutrient/mineral-rich soils. A general flow diagram and design principles for hot-desert bioregenerative life support systems (BLSS), which may be considered as solarpowered “bioreactors” with accelerated cycles of carbon and nutrients, are formulated. Research and design guidelines for BLSS solar energy utilization, accelerated food production, water production and recycling, and wastes processing are suggested. Environmental and socioeconomic benefits of building hot-desert BLSSes are discussed.},

            Ammonium contamination in water is a major concern worldwide. This study focuses on the removal of ammonium from aqueous solution by batch adsorption experiments using biochar derived from a combination of various wood chips (spruce, pine, and fir). Adsorption characteristics of ammonium onto biochar were evaluated as a function of biochar dosages, initial concentrations of ammonium, contact time and pH. Results demonstrated that ammonium removal increased with the increase of biochar dosage. The percentage of ammonium removal reached a value of 80\% at a biochar dosage of 100 g/L. Ammonium removal decreased by 15\% with the increase of initial ammonium concentration by 50 mg/L. The optimum pH for ammonium removal was considered in the range from 6 to 8. Ammonium removal reached its stable value within 3 days. The maximum adsorption capacity of ammonium was 0.96 mg/g for 80 mg/L of initial ammonium concentration. The adsorption isotherm followed both the Langmuir and Freundich models for ammonium adsorption onto biochar. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy results indicated the presence of amine, amide and nitrile functional groups on the surface of biochar which could contribute to the adsorption of ammonium onto biochar. Thus, biochar derived from various wood chips showed the potential to remove ammonium from aqueous solution.},

	abstract = {Due to its high adsorption capacity, the use of biochar to capture excess nutrients from wastewater has become a central focus in environmental remediation studies. In this study, its potential use in adsorption and removal of ammonium in piggery manure anaerobic digestate slurry was investigated. The adsorbed amount of NH4+-N (mg·g−1) and removal percentage as a function of adsorbent mass in solution, adsorbent particle size, NH4+-N concentration in the efﬂuent, contact time, pH and temperature were quantiﬁed in batch equilibrium and kinetics experiments. The maximum NH4+-N adsorption from slurry at 1400 mg N·L−1 was 44.64 ± 0.602 mg·g−1 and 39.8 ± 0.54 mg·g−1 for wood and rice husk biochar, respectively. For both biochars, adsorption increased with increase in contact time, temperature, pH and NH4+-N concentration but it decreased with increase in biochar particle size. Furthermore, the sorption process was endothermic and followed Langmuir (R2 = 0.995 and 0.998) and Pseudo-second order kinetic models (R2 = 0.998 and 0.999). Based on the removal amounts, we concluded that rice husk and wood biochar have potential to adsorb NH4+-N from piggery manure anaerobic digestate slurry, and thus can be used as nutrient ﬁlters prior to discharge into water streams.},

This has increased awareness amongst Vietnamese farmers for conducting shrimp farming according to speciﬁc certiﬁcation guidelines. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the situation of quality control and eﬀectiveness of Good Aquaculture Practices (GAP) in Vietnam (VietGAP) for intensive shrimp systems by making a comparison between VietGAP and non-GAP applied farms. The farmers in the GAP system performed well on seven control points related to quality management, especially regarding reservoir construction, water monitoring, and chemical use. Of the farms, 49\% reported disease, and the ratio of safety rejections was low. The farmers in non-GAP farms appeared to have weak practices in quality control with high usage of antibiotics, leading to 64\% of farmers reporting disease and 20\% of tested shipments being rejected. The VietGAP applied system has the potential to deal with disease and quality problems to increase export opportunity for Vannamei shrimp. However, VietGAP does not generate a high price premium in itself because it is not a recognized certiﬁcate in the global markets. The results reinforce previous ﬁndings regarding eco-certiﬁcation and how it can be a useful tool to reduce small-scale producers’ risk, even though it does not necessarily generate a price premium.},

Biochars exhibit broad pore size distribution from wide mesopores (5.0 nm) to narrow micropores (1.0 nm). Furthermore, all prepared biochars have both basic sites (2.8–8.13 meq/g) and acidic ones (1.8–9.3 meq/g) on their surface. The effect of biochar porosity, acidity, and basicity on anions adsorption was studied. KMnO4- and H2O2-treated biochar give high nitrite and nitrate uptake in micropore range (0.03–0.05 cc/g) and mesopore range (0.01–0.06 cc/g) while HNO3-treated ones give low uptake in both micropore range (0.02–0.021 cc/g) and mesopore range (0.01–0.05 cc/g). As a conclusion, no particular characteristics seem to be an influential essential in the removal of anionic contaminants. These observations are useful to guide the surface modification of biochars as efficient sorbents for specific application needs and removal of environmental pollutants.},

	abstract = {In this study, a novel bimetallic iron/nickel nanoparticles supported on biochar (BC@Fe/Ni) was established to degrade nitrate pollution in water. The nanocomposite was prepared from steel pickling waste liquor and sugarcane bagasse, which are made at low cost. The particle sizes of the nanocomposite ranged from about 10 nm to 20 nm and its speciﬁc surface area (59.83 m2/g) was about 71\% bigger than that of nanoscale zero valent iron prepared from steel pickling waste liquor (S-NZVI), which proved that biochar had an excellent dispersal effect on bimetallic iron/nickel particles. Without controlling the pH, high nitrate removal rates over 93\% could be realized in nitrate concentrations below 50 mg/L. The results of batch experiments demonstrated that the kinetics curves ﬁtted the pseudo-ﬁrst-order reaction well. And it was also found that higher dosages of the nanocomposite, lower initial nitrate concentrations, and acid medium facilitated nitrate degradation. In addition, the observed pseudo-ﬁrst order rate coefﬁcient in nitrate (20 mg/L) degradation rate by 4 g/L of the bimetallic iron/nickel supported on biochar was 30\% faster than that by 2 g/L the bimetallic iron/nickel nanoparticles, due to the existence of biochar. And it was 75\% faster than that by 2 g/L the nanoscale zero valent iron due to the existence of both biochar and the nanoscale zero valent nickel catalyst. Furthermore, iron and nickel ion pollution occurred in the denitriﬁcation system with bimetallic iron/nickel nanoparticles but not in that with the bimetallic iron/nickel nanoparticles supported on biochar, due to the biochar’s adsorption. After denitriﬁcation by the bimetallic iron/nickel nanoparticles supported on biochar, most of nitrate turned into ammonia (17.04 mg/L) and there only was a small amount of nitrite (0.024 mg/L) with high nitrate removal rate (99.5\%). And most of ammonia can be absorbed by cation exchange resin with ﬁnial ammonia concentration of 0.58 mg/L. At last, the concentrations of nitrate (0.24 mg/L), nitrite (0.021 mg/ L), and total nitrogen (0.84 mg/L) were lowest in the nanocomposite system. Overall, the bimetallic iron/ nickel nanoparticles supported on biochar exhibited clear advantages over bimetallic iron/nickel nanoparticles and nanoscale zero valent iron with respect to degrading nitrate efﬁciently, preventing iron and nickel pollution and removing ammonia pollution in combination with cation exchange resin.},

The focus of the research is to evaluate the adsorption potential of solid phase derived from rice straw for nitrate and nitrite anions in single- and binary-component systems due to the fact that the rice straw is a very abundant and by-product material. The removal was accomplished under the optimize conditions of temperature, concentration, pH, contact time and quantity of adsorbent as these parameters are some of the main factors inﬂuencing the uptake of two solutes at the solid–solution interface. Batch-mode kinetic and equilibrium studies have been carried out. The experimental data was analyzed using equilibrium isotherm and kinetic models. The thermodynamic parameters (DG°, DH°, and DS°) were also determined using the equilibrium constant value obtained at different temperatures.

	abstract = {In the modern industrial separation process, the pressure swing adsorption technology is widely used to separate and purify gases due to its low energy consumption, low cost, convenience, reliability, and environmental benignity. The basic elements of the design and application of the pressure swing adsorption process are adsorption isotherms at diﬀerent temperatures for adsorbents. The dual-site Langmuir (DSL) adsorption equilibrium model is the mostly used model; however, this model is based on the assumption that the adsorption energy on the surface of an adsorbent is uniform and remains unchanged. Here, a grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) molecular simulation was used to calculate the CO2 adsorption equilibrium on MIL-101 (Cr) at 298 K. MIL-101 (Cr) was chosen, as it has more a general pore structure with three diﬀerent pores. The calculation results showed that the adsorption energies with diﬀerent adsorption pressures ﬁtted a normal distribution and the relationship of the average adsorption energies, E with pressures had a linear form described as: E = aP + c. With this relationship, the parameter b = k·exp(E/RT) in the DSL model was modiﬁed to b = k·exp((aP + c)/RT), and the modiﬁed DSL model (M-DSL) was used to correlate the adsorption equilibrium data on CO2-MIL-101 (Cr), C2H4-HHPAC, CH4-BPL, and CO2-H-Mordenite, showing better correlations than those of the DSL model. We also extended the parameter qm in the M-DSL model with the equation qm = k1 + k2T to adsorption equilibrium data for diﬀerent temperatures. The obtained model (M-TDSL) was checked with the abovementioned adsorption equilibrium systems. The ﬁtting results also indicated that the M-TDSL model could be used to improve the correlation of adsorption equilibrium data for diﬀerent temperatures. The linear relationship between the average adsorption energy and adsorption pressure could be further tested in other adsorption equilibrium models to determine its universality.},

Each biochar type was tested at 5 different rates of 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0 and 0.5 kgm3, respectively. The results detailing the growth of water spinach showed that the application of rice husk biochar improves biomass production. The WB added to soil increased the plant weight of water spinach by increasing the root size and leaf width, whereas RHB added to soil increased plant weight by increasing the stem size and leaf length of the water spinach. In addition, the stem size of water spinach was proportional to the WHC/silt ratio; whereas the root size of water spinach was proportional to the OM/OC ratio of soil. We also proposed that the working mechanism of WB and RHB in soil would be such, that the decomposition of OC in biochar-added soil to OM resulted in increased WHC and decreased silt in biochar-added soil. The decomposition of WB biochar was faster than RHB under a lower dosage amount ({\textless} 1.5 kgm3), but this trend was inversed with a higher dosage ( {\textgreater} 3.0 kgm3).},

Moreover, HNO3-, Mg2+-, NaOH-, and NaOH+Mg2+-modified rice husk-derived biochars were prepared. Then all the five kinds of biochars, including the original biochar, were used as carriers of HNB to remove NH4+-N from water. Results showed that HNB was classified as Pseudomonas, and the 72-h NH4+-N removal ratio of the free bacteria reached 80.24\%. Compared with biochar itself, biochar-based HNB immobilization body showed a much stronger ability to remove NH4+-N, especially for NaOH- and NaOH+Mg2+-modified biochars. At the initial NH4+-N concentration of 100 mg/L and biochar addition dose of 10 g/L, NH4+-N removal ratio of NaOH- and NaOH+Mg2+-modified biochar-based HNB immobilization bodies reached 57.78\% and 58.35\% after 5 h, and reached 88.66\% and 90.93\% after 48 h respectively, which were obviously higher than the original, HNO3- and Mg2+-modified biochar-based HNB immobilization bodies. The phenomenon resulted from significantly higher bacteria adsorption ability of NaOH- and NaOH+Mg2+-modified biochars, which reached 773.75 and 941.17 nmol P/g biochar, respectively.},

	abstract = {Composting always proved to be the Nature-friendly and sustainable method for getting rid of the huge burden of biowaste. As we witness, there is an intractable growth of human population and their unlimited consumption of different goods produce a tremendous amount of waste. In New Delhi itself, more than 9500 tons of waste is generated every day, out of which 8000 tons per day goes to the landfilling, which is the most commonly practiced method. This malignant process instead of solving the problem of waste, in turn, causes more problems like methane emission, heavy metal leaching into groundwater, soil pollution, etc. Composting mimics natural mineralization process which is the alternative solution of resource recovery with no side-effects. To curb such a huge amount of waste, the composting process must be rapidified and achieved by in-vessel composting, where the partial anaerobic condition is reduced by enforced aeration and critical parameters like moisture and temperature can be controlled. Aerobic bacteria are the main agents which speed up the composting process. Moreover, easily available natural additives like buttermilk, jaggery, sugar, etc. also speed up the microbial process and increase the efficiency. So, the in-vessel composting provides efficient compost in a very short time period. This paper will provide a critical assessment of In-vessel composting in terms of process parameters and efficiency in comparison with conventional methods. This process can be critically utilized for community-based composting at small scale compost production, which will be a key to link daily household waste with resource generation with the aim to achieve Swach Bharat Mission.},

For this purpose, in-vessel bioreactor was designed and used to evaluate both appropriate initial air pressure and appropriate initial moisture content for the composting process. Moreover, 5 experiments were carried out within initial moisture content of 55\%, 65\%, 70\%, 75\% and 85\%. The initial air pressure and the initial moisture content of the mixture showed a significant effect on the aerobic composting. The experimental results demonstrated that for composting organic waste, relatively high moisture contents are better at achieving higher temperatures and retaining them for longer times. This study suggested that an initial moisture content of around 75\%, under 0.6 bar, can be considered as being suitable for efficient composting of organic fraction of municipal solid waste. These last conditions, allowed maximum value of temperature and final composting product with good physicochemical properties as well as higher organic matter degradation and higher gas production. Moreover, final compost obtained showed good maturity levels and can be used for agricultural applications.},

	abstract = {In mathematics, a fractal is a subset of Euclidean space with a fractal dimension that strictly exceeds its topological dimension. Fractals appear the same at different scales, as illustrated in successive magnifications of the Mandelbrot set. Fractals exhibit similar patterns at increasingly smaller scales, a property called self-similarity, also known as expanding symmetry or unfolding symmetry; if this replication is exactly the same at every scale, as in the Menger sponge, it is called affine self-similar.  Fractal geometry lies within the mathematical branch of measure theory.
One way that fractals are different from finite geometric figures is how they scale. Doubling the edge lengths of a polygon multiplies its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (the dimension of the space the polygon resides in). Likewise, if the radius of a sphere is doubled, its volume scales by eight, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old radius) to the power of three (the dimension that the sphere resides in). However, if a fractal's one-dimensional lengths are all doubled, the spatial content of the fractal scales by a power that is not necessarily an integer. This power is called the fractal dimension of the fractal, and it usually exceeds the fractal's topological dimension.Analytically, most fractals are nowhere differentiable. An infinite fractal curve can be conceived of as winding through space differently from an ordinary line – although it is still  topologically 1-dimensional, its fractal dimension indicates that it also resembles a surface.

Starting in the 17th century with notions of recursion, fractals have moved through increasingly rigorous mathematical treatment to the study of continuous but not differentiable functions in the 19th century by the seminal work of Bernard Bolzano, Bernhard Riemann, and Karl Weierstrass, and on to the coining of the word fractal in the 20th century with a subsequent burgeoning of interest in fractals and computer-based modelling in the 20th century. The term "fractal" was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1975. Mandelbrot based it on the Latin frāctus, meaning "broken" or "fractured", and used it to extend the concept of theoretical fractional dimensions to geometric patterns in nature.There is some disagreement among mathematicians about how the concept of a fractal should be formally defined. Mandelbrot himself summarized it as "beautiful, damn hard, increasingly useful. That's fractals." More formally, in 1982 Mandelbrot defined fractal as follows: "A fractal is by definition a set for which the Hausdorff–Besicovitch dimension strictly exceeds the topological dimension." Later, seeing this as too restrictive, he simplified and expanded the definition to this: "A fractal is a shape made of parts similar to the whole in some way." Still later, Mandelbrot proposed "to use fractal without a pedantic definition, to use fractal dimension as a generic term applicable to all the variants".The consensus among mathematicians is that theoretical fractals are infinitely self-similar, iterated, and detailed mathematical constructs having fractal dimensions, of which many examples have been formulated and studied. Fractals are not limited to geometric patterns, but can also describe processes in time. Fractal patterns with various degrees of self-similarity have been rendered or studied in images, structures, and sounds and found in nature, technology, art, architecture and law. Fractals are of particular relevance in the field of chaos theory because the graphs of most chaotic processes are fractals. Many real and model networks have been found to have fractal features such as self similarity.},

It explains how it was a premeditated, orchestrated deception, using science to impose a political agenda. It fooled a majority including most scientists. They assumed that other scientists would not produce science for a political agenda. German Physicist and meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls finally decided to look for himself. Here is what he discovered. Ten years ago I simply parroted what the IPCC told us. One day I started checking the facts and data—first I started with a sense of doubt but then I became outraged when I discovered that much of what the IPCC and the media were telling us was sheer nonsense and was not even supported by any scientific facts and measurements. To this day I still feel shame that as a scientist I made presentations of their science without first checking it.…scientifically it is sheer absurdity to think we can get a nice climate by turning a CO2 adjustment knob.   This book uses the same approach used in investigative journalism. It examines the Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How.},

Exposed is the greenhouse gas chimera—mythical sky dragon.The world has witnessed a frenzy of unverifiable claims that human emissions of a trace gas—carbon dioxide—are causing unprecedented global warming. Despite the relentless rise of levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), global temperatures refuse to show any statistically meaningful rise.The Sky Dragon Slayers: Victory Lap reveals in forensic detail how the evidence relied upon by policymakers and environmentalists to swell alarm is mostly untrustworthy and bungled secret science manufactured by a clique of well-funded government researchers.Long-held assumptions are depicted as fact, while unknowns and uncertainties, which should have been declared, are unethically cloaked in a veneer of confident predictions of impending doom and gloom.Herein, unpicking this dilemma is a stellar team of authors and researchers—the Slayers of sky dragons. Among them are some of the world’s foremost scientists. They include Dr. Tim Ball, the internationally renowned climatologist; Dr. Pierre R. Latour, a world-leading expert on carbon dioxide recently honored with a lifetime achievement award in science and Dr. George V. Chilingar, among the world’s most decorated applied scientists who served the United Nations with distinction as science adviser.The most astonishing conclusion reached, after thorough examination of all the evidence, is that carbon dioxide more likely cools, not warms our planet. It is the polar opposite of what consensus claims have told us. The biggest climate threat we face isn’t warming, but a new ice age!},

The organism was differentiated by observing clearing zones on indicator agar plates containing 1,000 ppm atrazine. Detailed taxonomic studies identified the organism as a Pseudomonas sp., designated ADP, that was dissimilar to currently known species. Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP metabolized atrazine as its sole nitrogen source. Nongrowing suspended cells also metabolized atrazine rapidly; for example, 9 x 10(sup9) cells per ml degraded 100 ppm of atrazine in 90 min. Atrazine was metabolized to hydroxyatrazine, polar metabolites, and carbon dioxide. When uniformly ring-labeled [(sup14)C]atrazine was used, 80\% of the radioactivity was liberated as (sup14)CO(inf2). These data indicated the triazine ring was completely mineralized. The isolation and characterization of Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP may contribute to efforts on atrazine bioremediation, particularly in environments containing very high pesticide levels.},

LAND is OPPORTUNITY : Sustainable Harvesters

Meet Matthew Braud, Co-founder of Sustainable Harvesters which was formed out of the necessity for fresh and local produce in the Houston, Texas market.

Their mission, passion  and commitment is to grow the freshest produce using the most efficient, sustainable, and safest technology available. 

Sustainable Harvesters has over 12,000 square feet of environmentally controlled greenhouse that has the capacity to grow over 7,000 heads of lettuce every week utilizing growing techniques called Aquaponics.

Aquaponics is the combination of aquaculture (raising fish) and hydroponics (the soil-less growing of plants) that grows fish and plants together in one integrated system.

Coming this Summer - expansion of another 8,000 square feet!

	abstract = {Biochar is a carbon rich solid material resulting from the pyrolysis of biomass under oxygen-free and low temperature conditions. Although most research is directed towards the application of biochar to soils, there are several other biochar properties that render it a suitable candidate for non-soil applications. A growing number of studies have tested biochar as a composite in building materials, as a hazardous substance adsorbent in drinking water and wastewater, and as a component in filters for indoor air quality and storm water management. The potential to utilize biochar for various applications depends on its properties. For example, biochar with high electrical conductivity, porosity and stability at lower temperatures is preferred as electrodes material in microbial fuel cells.]

Biochar containing relatively high structural bound oxygen groups is preferred in direct carbon fuel cells. On the other hand, biochars with increased particle strength, hydrophobicity and high surface area are suitable candidates for the development of reusable catalysts for chemical reactions. These new high-value applications are still in their infancy, and further research and development is needed to reach commercialization. Optimum reaction conditions for producing biochar are not always the same and reproducibility is often not satisfactory, even when the same biomass is used and the same production conditions are present. This book on non-soil biochar applications aims to highlight the diversity of biochar as a multi-functional material and introduce some new and emerging applications to the wider scientific community. It will act as a reference document to all groups and individuals working or interested in biochar research and will be a valuable contribution to existing published literature.},

Five compounds, considered ECs and that act as endocrine disruptors, were analyzed: Diclofenac, Ibuprofen, Ketorolac, Pentachlorophenol (PCP), and Estradiol. The toxicity level (TEQ) of the ECs is estimated by a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) analysis, evaluating their concentration and assessing the risk involved in the incorporation of each one into the environment. The presence of the ECs was conﬁrmed in all the studied sites. It was attested that the concentrations of pollutants Diclofenac, Ibuprofen, Ketorolac, and Pentachlorophenol were within the toxic range, whereas the compound Estradiol was found in concentrations that represent a high toxicity in the same eﬄuents. This research recognizes that the analysis of the physicochemical properties of substances allows for predicting whether a contaminant is likely to act and persist in the environment and, in turn, bioaccumulate in organisms.},

	abstract = {Some of the barriers associated with the land application of biosolids generated in wastewater treatment plants can be eliminated simply by converting the biosolids into biochar using a thermal conversion process called “pyrolysis”. In the current work, eight biosolids from four different wastewater treatment plants in southeast Melbourne, Victoria, Australia were collected and pyrolysed to produce biochars at two different temperatures (500 and 700 ◦C). In addition, characterisation studies were carried out on the biochars to obtain their physicochemical properties, which were subsequently compared with the properties of the parent biosolids. The major ﬁndings of the work demonstrated that biochars exhibited large decreases in DTPA-extractable metals such as Cd, Cu, and Zn, and also led to favorable changes in several chemical and physical characteristics (i.e., pH, Olsen P, electrical conductivity, and surface area) for agricultural land application compared to their original form (i.e., biosolids). Overall, the study suggests that there is great potential for converting biosolids to biochar using pyrolysis. This may not only improve the properties of biosolids for land application, but also has potential to reduce the risk to receiving environments and, furthermore, eliminate many of the costly elements associated with biosolids stockpiling and management.},

	abstract = {Heavy metals have become one of the most serious anthropogenic stressors for plants and other living organisms. Having efﬁcient and feasible bioassays available to assess the ecotoxicological risks deriving from soil pollution is necessary. This work determines pollution by Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, V and Zn in two soils used for growing rice from the Albufera Natural Park in Valencia (Spain). Both were submitted to a different degree of anthropic activity, and their ecotoxicological risk was assessed by four ecotoxicity tests to compare their effectiveness: MicrotoxÒ test, Zucconi test, pot bioassay (PB) and soil plate bioassay (SPB). The sensitivity of three plant species (barley, cress and lettuce) was also assessed. The results reveal a different degree of effectiveness and level of inhibition in the target organisms’ growth depending on the test applied, to such an extent that the one-way analysis of variance showed signiﬁcant differences only for the plate bioassay results, with considerable inhibition of root and shoot elongation in seedlings. Of the three plant species selected, lettuce was the most sensitive species to toxic effects, followed by cress and barley. Finally, the results also indicate that the SPB is an efﬁcient, simple and economic alternative to other ecotoxicological assays to assess toxicity risks deriving from soil pollution.},

	abstract = {Co-contamination of the environment with toxic chlorinated organic and heavy metal pollutants is one of the major problems facing industrialized nations today. Heavy metals may inhibit biodegradation of chlorinated organics by interacting with enzymes directly involved in biodegradation or those involved in general metabolism. Predictions of metal toxicity effects on organic pollutant biodegradation in co-contaminated soil and water environments is difficult since heavy metals may be present in a variety of chemical and physical forms. Recent advances in bioremediation of co-contaminated environments have focussed on the use of metal-resistant bacteria (cell and gene bioaugmentation), treatment amendments, clay minerals and chelating agents to reduce bioavailable heavy metal concentrations. Phytoremediation has also shown promise as an emerging alternative clean-up technology for co-contaminated environments. However, despite various investigations, in both aerobic and anaerobic systems, demonstrating that metal toxicity hampers the biodegradation of the organic component, a paucity of information exists in this area of research. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the problems associated with the degradation of chlorinated organics in co-contaminated environments, owing to metal toxicity and shed light on possible improvement strategies for effective bioremediation of sites co-contaminated with chlorinated organic compounds and heavy metals.},

	abstract = {In electrochemistry, and more generally in solution chemistry, a Pourbaix diagram, also known as a potential/pH diagram, EH–pH diagram or a pE/pH diagram, is a plot of possible thermodynamically stable phases (i.e., at chemical equilibrium) of an aqueous electrochemical system. Boundaries (50 \%/50 \%) between the predominant chemical species (aqueous ions in solution, or solid phases) are represented by lines. As such a Pourbaix diagram can be read much like a standard phase diagram with a different set of axes. Similarly to phase diagrams, they do not allow for reaction rate or kinetic effects. Beside potential and pH, the equilibrium concentrations are also dependent upon, e.g., temperature, pressure, and concentration. Pourbaix diagrams are commonly given at room temperature, atmospheric pressure, and molar concentrations of 10−6 and changing any of these parameters will yield a different diagram.
The diagrams are named after Marcel Pourbaix (1904–1998), the Russian-born Belgian chemist who invented them.},

	abstract = {Developments in soil ecotoxicology started with observations on pesticide effects on soil invertebrates in the 1960s. To support the risk assessment of chemicals, in the 1980s and 1990s development of toxicity tests was the main issue, including single species tests and also more realistic test systems like model ecosystems and field tests focusing on structural and functional endpoints. In the mean time, awareness grew about issues like bioavailability and routes of exposure, while biochemical endpoints (biomarkers) were proposed as sensitive and potential early-warning tools. In recent years, interactions between different chemicals (mixture toxicity) and between chemical and other stressors attracted scientific interest. With the development of molecular biology, omics tools are gaining increasing interest, while the ecological relevance of exposure and effects is translating into concepts like (chemical) stress ecology, ecological vulnerability and trait-based approaches. This contribution addresses historical developments and focuses on current issues in soil ecotoxicology. It is concluded that soil ecotoxicological risk assessment would benefit from extending the available battery of toxicity tests by including e.g. isopods, by paying more attention to exposure, bioavailability and toxicokinetics, and by developing more insight into the ecology of soil organisms to support better understanding of exposure and long-term consequences of chemical exposure at the individual, population and community level. Ecotoxicogenomics tools may also be helpful in this, but will require considerable further research before they can be applied in the practice of soil ecotoxicological risk assessment.},

	abstract = {To characterize the potential toxicity of low Pb- and Cd-contaminated arable soils, earthworms were exposed to Pb contaminated ferrosol, cambosol or Cd contaminated ferrosol for two weeks. Polar metabolites of earthworms were detected by nuclear magnetic resonance. Data were then analyzed with principal component analysis followed by orthogonal signal correction-partial least squares-discriminant analysis and univariate analysis to determine possible mechanisms for the changes in metabolites. The survival rates, metal concentrations and bioaccumulation factor (BAF) of the earthworms were also measured and calculated as auxiliary data. The results showed that the metabolite profiles were highly similar in Pb-contaminated ferrosol and cambosol (R2 = 0.76, p {\textless} 0.0001), which can be attributed to similar response mechanisms. However, there was a more intense response in ferrosol likely due to higher Pb concentrations in earthworms. Metabolic pathways and BAFs exhibited apparent distinctions between Pb- and Cd-contaminated ferrosol, likely because they bind to different bio-ligands. The affected metabolic pathways were involved in alanine-aspartate-glutamate, purine, glutathione, valine-leucine-isoleucine biosynthesis and degradation and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. Regarding the bioavailability in earthworms, Pb availability was higher for ferrosol than for cambosol. We confirmed that the potential toxicity of low Pb/Cd-contaminated soils can be characterized using earthworm metabolomics.},

In this study, we investigated the effect of glucose concentration on growth kinetics of Pseudomonas putida during toluene degradation for a wide concentration range (60–250 mg/l). Batch microcosm studies were conducted in order to monitor bacterial growth for three different initial concentrations (2, 5, 10 mg/ml) of glucose for a given toluene concentration. Modeling of growth kinetics was also performed for each growth curve of glucose dose using both Monod and Haldane kinetics. Batch studies revealed that bacterial growth showed a distinct inhibitory phase above some limit (∼170 mg/l) for the lowest (2 mg/ml) glucose dose, but the degree of inhibition decreased as the glucose dose increased, leading to three different growth patterns. The bacterial growth followed each of the modified Wayman and Tseng, Wayman and Tseng, and Luong model as the glucose dose increased from 2 to 10 mg/ml. This indicates that glucose has a prominent influence on bacterial growth during toluene degradation and that different kinetics should be adopted for each broth condition.},

	abstract = {Pyrethroid insecticides have been used to control pests in agriculture, forestry, horticulture, public health and for indoor home use for more than 20 years. Because pyrethroids were considered to be a safer alternative to organophosphate pesticides (OPs), their applications signiﬁcantly increased when the use of OPs was banned or limited. Although, pyrethroids have agricultural beneﬁts, their widespread and continuous use is a major problem as they pollute the terrestrial and aquatic environments and affect non-target organisms. Since pyrethroids are not degraded immediately after application and because their residues are detected in soils, there is an urgent need to remediate pyrethroid-polluted environments. Various remediation technologies have been developed for this purpose; however, bioremediation, which involves bioaugmentation and/or biostimulation and is a cost-effective and eco-friendly approach, has emerged as the most advantageous method for cleaning-up pesticide-contaminated soils. This review presents an overview of the microorganisms that have been isolated from pyrethroid-polluted sites, characterized and applied for the degradation of pyrethroids in liquid and soil media. The paper is focused on the microbial degradation of the pyrethroids that have been most commonly used for many years such as allethrin, bifenthrin, cyﬂuthrin, cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, fenpropathrin, fenvalerate, and permethrin. Special attention is given to the bacterial strains from the genera Achromobacter, Acidomonas, Bacillus, Brevibacterium, Catellibacterium, Clostridium, Lysinibacillus, Micrococcus, Ochrobactrum, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Sphingobium, Streptomyces, and the fungal strains from the genera Aspergillus, Candida, Cladosporium, and Trichoderma, which are characterized by their ability to degrade various pyrethroids. Moreover, the current knowledge on the degradation pathways of pyrethroids, the enzymes that are involved in the cleavage of pesticide molecules, the factors/conditions that inﬂuence the survival of strains that are introduced into soil and the rate of the removal of pyrethroids are also discussed. This knowledge may be useful to optimize the environmental conditions of bioremediation and may be crucial for the effective removal of pyrethroids from polluted soils.},

	abstract = {Metabolically versatile free-living bacteria have global regulation systems that allow cells to selectively assimilate a preferred compound among a mixture of several potential carbon sources. This process is known as carbon catabolite repression (CCR). CCR optimizes metabolism, improving the ability of bacteria to compete in their natural habitats. This review summarizes the regulatory mechanisms responsible for CCR in the bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas, which can live in many different habitats. Although the information available is still limited, the molecular mechanisms responsible for CCR in Pseudomonas are clearly different from those of Enterobacteriaceae or Firmicutes. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying CCR is important to know how metabolism is regulated and how bacteria degrade compounds in the environment. This is particularly relevant for compounds that are degraded slowly and accumulate, creating environmental problems. CCR has a major impact on the genes involved in the transport and metabolism of nonpreferred carbon sources, but also affects the expression of virulence factors in several bacterial species, genes that are frequently directed to allow the bacterium to gain access to new sources of nutrients. Finally, CCR has implications in the optimization of biotechnological processes such as biotransformations or bioremediation strategies.},

Furthermore, heavy metals accumulation and pesticide residues in soils and plants have been discussed in detail. In addition, the characteristics of contaminated soil and plant physiological parameters have been reviewed. Moreover, human diseases caused by exposure to heavy metals and pesticides were also reported. The bioaccumulation, mechanism of action, and transmission pathways of both heavy metals and pesticides are emphasized. In addition, the bioavailability in soil and plant uptake of these contaminants has also been considered. Meanwhile, the synergistic and antagonistic interactions between heavy metals and pesticides and their combined toxic effects have been discussed. Previous relevant studies are included to cover all aspects of this review.

	abstract = {Xenobiotics are the chemicals, which are not found in nature and are said to be foreign substances in the atmosphere. These compounds are synthesized by human beings e.g. pesticides, that may be added in the soil to kill the harmful pests but in addition this, these pesticides also kill the beneﬁcial microorganisms that are responsible for the fertility of soil. Moreover, these compounds can be accumulated in food chain and cause harm to the ﬂora and fauna of such ecosystem. For the degradation of such xenobiotic compounds various physico-chemical and biological methods have been used but all these methods produce toxic by-products that are hazardous to the environment. Thus Bioremediation is a promising tool for the degradation of such compounds. In the present paper, we have emphasized on the remediation of xenobiotics by using microorganisms. Bacteria and Fungi play an important role in breaking down certain hazardous substances into simpler fragmented forms. Bacteria, which are used for bioremediation of xenobiotics includes aerobic, anaerobic, Methanotrophic, Methanogenic bacteria, Cyanobacteria and Sphingomonads. Pseudomonas species has been used for the degradation of several xenobiotic compounds. In addition to this, certain fungi such as Aspergillus, Rhizopus, Botrytis, Neurospora etc. have been used for the heavy metal biosorption. Hence we can say that fungi are one of the promising tools for the eco-friendly degradation of xenobiotic.},

These hazardous toxic pollutants include a variety of organic and inorganic compounds, which pose a serious threat to the ecosystem. The contamination of soil and water are the major environmental concerns in the present scenario. This leads to a greater need for remediation of contaminated soils and water with suitable approaches and mechanisms. The conventional remediation of contaminated sites commonly involves the physical removal of contaminants, and their disposition. Physical remediation strategies are expensive, non-speciﬁc and often make the soil unsuitable for agriculture and other uses by disturbing the microenvironment. Owing to these concerns, there has been increased interest in eco-friendly and sustainable approaches such as bioremediation, phytoremediation and rhizoremediation for the cleanup of contaminated sites. This review lays particular emphasis on biotechnological approaches and strategies for heavy metal and metalloid containment removal from the environment, highlighting the advances and implications of bioremediation and phytoremediation as well as their utilization in cleaning-up toxic pollutants from contaminated environments.},

Cell surface charges and hydrophobicity of L. monocytogenes Scott A were also determined by electrophoretic mobility, hydrophobic-interaction chromatography, and contact angle measurements. Electrokinetic measurements indicated that the strain Scott A has a negative electrophoretic mobility. Physicochemical characterization of L. monocytogenes by various methods indicates that this microorganism is hydrophilic. All L. monocytogenes strains tested with the salt aggregation test method aggregated a at very high ammonium sulfate molarities. The hydrophobicity-interaction chromatography results show that L. monocytogenes Scott A cells do not adhere to octyl-Sepharose unless the pH is low. Results from contact angle measurements showed that the surface free energy of strain Scott A was 65.9 mJ.m-2, classifying this microorganism as a hydrophilic bacterium. In addition, the interfacial free energy of adhesion of L. monocytogenes Scott A estimated for polypropylene and rubber was lower than that for glass and stainless steel. However, these theoretical implications could not be correlated with the attachment capabilities of L. monocytogenes.},

This work aimed to isolate an indigenous microalgal strain (named MBFJNU-1) from swine wastewater efﬂuent and identify as Chlorella vulgaris. After 12 days, the removal efﬁciencies of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in undiluted swine slurry were 90.51\% and 91.54\%, respectively. Stress tolerance in response to wastewater was veriﬁed by cultivating in artiﬁcial wastewater containing different levels of chemical oxygen demand (COD), TN and TP. MBFJNU-1 could grow well in undiluted swine slurry and artiﬁcial wastewater containing 30,000 mg/L COD or 2000 mg/L TN. Furthermore, global nuclear DNA methylation (5-mC) of MBFJNU-1 was employed to explore the possible mechanism in response to wastewater stress. The results showed that the level of 5-mC was inversely proportional to the growth of MBFJNU-1 in different diluted swine slurry, helping to understand 5-mC variation in response to stress environment.},

	abstract = {The potential of various biochars to remove 15 odorous volatile organic compounds emitted from swine manure were investigated via laboratory sorption experiments. Nine biochars made from pyrolyzing poultry litter, swine manure, oak, and coconut shell at 350 °C and 500 °C and a commercial coconut-shell activated carbon were evaluated for their sorption capacities toward the odorous compounds. These 15 odorous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) consisted of reduced sulfur compounds, volatile fatty acids, phenolic, and indolic compounds. The sorption capacities of these biochars were investigated using a laboratory-scale sorption column system. Among the 15 targeted VOCs, acetic acid was the most predominant compound in the emitted gas from swine manure; however, its contribution to the complex swine manure odor mixture was minimal. Dimethyl disulﬁde (DMDS) and dimethyl trisulﬁde (DMTS) were the two most odor-causing VOCs in the swine manure emissions based on single compound odor active values. Livestock-manure-based biochars were poor sorbents for DMDS and DMTS. In contrast, plant-biomass-based biochars had considerably larger sorption capacity for DMDS and DMTS. Oak biochar pyrolyzed at 500 °C (OK500) showed high sorption capacities for both DMDS and DMTS. Although the sorption capacity of OK500 for DMDS is less than that of commercial activated carbon, it may provide additional income for users if the spent OK500 biochar can be sold as a soil amendment.},

First, we showed that the physiological stage of the bacterial culture had no effect on nodulation and growth of the seedlings of Acacia mangium inoculated and cultivated in vitro for four months. For Leucaena leucocephala, the number of nodules was significantly higher when the seedlings were inoculated with a bacterial culture in stationary phase. On the other hand, whatever the species, no significant difference was noted with regards to the dry weight of the shoots. The effect of the size of inoculum on the nodulation and growth of the seedlings was studied in L. leucocephala after five months in a greenhouse. Our result show that an inoculation with bacterial cultures containing 109 to 1010 bacteria per milliliter are the optimal conditions to have a maximum nodulation and growth of the seedlings. The two legume plant species showed significant differences with regard to the effect of the method of inoculation on nodulation and growth of the seedlings. For Acacia mangium, inoculation with a liquid culture one week after sowing was more favourable for the growth of the seedlings. On the other hand, for Leucaena leucocephala, this method of inoculation and the coating of seeds with a bacterial culture mixed with arabic gum improved significantly the growth of the seedlings. Results obtained in our study can be useful for the partners from developing countries involved in the large scale production of tree seedlings.},

This study aims at identifying the optimal values of different chemical and physical factors directly influencing the sporulation process of the actinomycete, which serves as a basis to produce a bio-fungicide to control the disease. The optimum multifactorial experiments were designed using the Plackett-Burman matrix. Results showed that the initial moisture content, culture duration and CaCO3 content had the strongest influences on the sporulation process. These three factors were subsequently optimized using the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) combined with the Central Composite Design (CCD). Optimal values of the initial moisture content, culture duration and CaCO3 were 54\%v/w, 3.6 days and 3 g, respectively. These values formed a model which was tested in a bio-assay. An amount of 4,8x109 spores/g was obtained in that assay. The Plackett-Burman matrix combined with the RSM-CCD is therefore a useful tool to identify optimal values of different factors influencing microbial sporulation processes.},

Based on the results of phenotypic features, phylogenetic similarity of 16S rRNA gene sequences and BIOLOG test, strain YC-1 was identiﬁed as the genus Stenotrophomonas. The isolate utilized chlorpyrifos as the sole source of carbon and phosphorus for its growth and hydrolyzed chlorpyrifos to 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol. Parathion, methyl parathion, and fenitrothion also could be degraded by strain YC-1 when provided as the sole source of carbon and phosphorus. The gene encoding the organophosphorus hydrolase was cloned using a PCR cloning strategy based on the known methyl parathion degrading (mpd) gene of Plesiomonas sp. M6. Sequence BLAST result indicated this gene has 99\% similar to mpd. The inoculation of strain YC-1 (106 cells gÀ1) to soil treated with 100 mg kgÀ1 chlorpyrifos resulted in a higher degradation rate than in noninoculated soils. Theses results highlight the potential of this bacterium to be used in the cleanup of contaminated pesticide waste in the environment.},

However, it is now recognised that a diverse microbial community exists in the airways comprising aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as fungi and viruses. This rich soup of microorganisms provides ample opportunity for interspecies interactions, particularly when considering secreted compounds. Here, we discuss how P. aeruginosa-secreted products can have community-wide effects, with the potential to ultimately shape microbial community dynamics within the lung. We focus on three well-studied traits associated with worsening clinical outcome in CF: phenazines, siderophores and biofilm formation, and discuss how secretions can shape interactions between P. aeruginosa and other commonly encountered members of the lung microbiome: Staphylococcus aureus, the Burkholderia cepacia complex, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. These interactions may shape the evolutionary trajectory of P. aeruginosa while providing new opportunities for therapeutic exploitation of the CF lung microbiome.},

              , isolated from
              Eucalyptus dunnii
              leaves, exhibits antifungal properties against five tested phytopathogenic fungi. The strain is a Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium containing a single polar flagellum. It is strictly aerobic, grows at 4–37 °C, 2–5\% NaCl, and pH 3–7. The 16S rRNA sequence analysis showed that NP-1
               T
              belongs to the
              Pseudomonas

Pseudomonas fluorescens UTPF5 was originally obtained from onion field. Biochemical and physiological characteristics of this strain refer to biovar 3 of P. fluorescens. Strain UTPF5 is an effective bacterium against several phytopathogenic fungi. Pyoverdine type siderophore of this strain was isolated using XAD amberlite column. The plant growth promotion and antifungal properties of bacteria were demonstrated under greenhouse conditions in combination with Fe-EDTA, Fe-EDDHA and Zn as modulators of pyoverdine production. Amendment with zinc, Fe-EDTA and Fe-EDDHA suppressed the disease inhibition when partially used with UTPF5. 7NSK2 and its pyoverdine mutant, MPFM1, were used as reference strains the inhibition percent of which was not affect by soil amendment. Iron chelates, especially Fe-EDDHA, increased growth and chlorophyll production by plants. This effect was improved in the presence of bacterial strains. The siderophore mutant MPFM1 did not exhibit satisfactory disease inhibition and growth promotion activity. In vitro experiments showed that purified pyoverdine could decrease the fungal growth to the same extent as pyoverdine-producing strain.},

	abstract = {Understanding how biological systems convert and store energy is a primary purpose of basic research. However, despite Mitchell's chemiosmotic theory, we are far from the complete description of basic processes such as oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and photosynthesis. After more than half a century, the chemiosmotic theory may need updating, thanks to the latest structural data on respiratory chain complexes. In particular, up-to date technologies, such as those using fluorescence indicators following proton displacements, have shown that proton translocation is lateral rather than transversal with respect to the coupling membrane. Furthermore, the definition of the physical species involved in the transfer (proton, hydroxonium ion or proton currents) is still an unresolved issue, even though the latest acquisitions support the idea that protonic currents, difficult to measure, are involved.

              -ATP synthase ubiquitous motor enzyme has the peculiarity (unlike most enzymes) of affecting the thermodynamic equilibrium of ATP synthesis. It seems that the concept of diffusion of the proton charge expressed more than two centuries ago by Theodor von Grotthuss is to be taken into consideration to resolve these issues. All these uncertainties remind us that also in biology it is necessary to consider the Heisenberg indeterminacy principle, which sets limits to analytical questions.},

	abstract = {Leadership and management are general skills that apply in most walks of life, but in the scientific domain they require some special characteristics. Science thrives on challenge, whether it is the technical challenge of trying to do something which has not been done before or challenging a widely held but poorly supported hypothesis. Scientists are trained to challenge, and for the manager of science this can itself be a challenge. In the past, when science was ona much smaller scale and less subject to public scrutiny, a less formal 'back-of-the-envelope' management style was acceptable, but those days are long-gone. Science costs much more and is rightly more accountable. Excellent scientists, however, do not necessarily make good managers and may not makegood leaders. Nevertheless, like all skills, leadership and management can be enhanced and developed and even instinctively good managers can improve.While the science of management and leadership is well developed, the management and leadership of science is less so. This book aims to introduce the working research scientist to the art and techniques of management and the skills necessary to be a good and effective manager and leader of science and scientists. This includes understanding the organization and functioning of scientific research establishments (universities, laboratories, research councils, etc.) and how to deal with theassociated committee work, recruiting, and team building; how to deal with difficulties managing projects and handling risks. The approach is pragmatic not dogmatic. Leadership and management are people skills, and each person is different and needs to be treated differently. The focus is on theprinciple and practice. While the subject is serious, the approach is conversational, with anecdotes and practical examples.},

In Lab Dynamics, Carl and Suzanne Cohen draw on their unparalleled professional experience (Carl as ascientist and Suzanne as a psychologist) and as workshop directors to provide invaluable, practical advice on how to succeed in science for working scientists and those in or preparing for management or leadership roles. The book is also required reading for anyone with an administrative role in theresearch enterprise who must understand that world and its complexities. At its core, the book is about human interactions in science and how they can be made most effective and productive. The authors explain, without jargon or preaching, how to apply self-awareness and interpersonal skills to problems that science professionals encounter every day. For this third edition, two new chapters have been added. The new Chapter 4, on hiring scientists, provides a data-driven approach along with step-by-step guidance and editable and downloadable forms for use in evaluating and ranking applicants. The new Chapter 6 gives a guide to keeping scientistsfocused and motivated through appropriate feedback. Scientists at all levels want and need to hear how they're doing from mentors, managers, or leaders. All other chapters have additional sections, many based on case studies and examples shared with the authors by working scientists. They include "Ten essential characteristics of scientific team leaders" with specific examples of each behavior and its impact. Government organizations, academic institutions, and funders are increasingly focused on the management of science and the improvement of the scientific enterprise. With this update, Lab Dynamics is a resource like no other for those who lead and strive to succeed in a scientific setting.},

	abstract = {This chapter considers the use of a variety of approaches to assess either the bioavailability or the bioaccessibility of metals in soil. The bioavailability of metals from soils is considered with respect to a series of single-extraction methods, including the use of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), acetic acid, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), ammonium nitrate, calcium chloride and sodium nitrate. Then, a procedure for the recovery of metals using a three-stage sequential extraction protocol is described. Two alternate approaches for assessing the environmental health risk to humans by undertaking in vitro gastrointestinal extraction (also known as the physiologically based extraction test, PBET) are considered. Finally, two acid digestion protocols that allow the pseudo-total metal content of samples to be assessed are provided.In all cases details of how the different approaches can be performed are provided, including the specific reagents required (and their preparation), details of the different extraction and acid digestion protocols to be followed and suitable analytical details to allow the measurement of metals by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with/without a collision/reaction cell. A detailed Notes section provides experimental details to guide the reader through some of the practical aspects of the procedures. Finally, some experimental results are provided as evidence of the suitability of the approaches described including single-extraction data, using EDTA and acetic acid, for metals in CRM BCR 700. In addition, in vitro gastrointestinal extraction data are provided for metals in CRM SRM 1570A (spinach leaves). The influence of time on the intestinal fluid phase on the recovery of metals in CRM SRM 1570A (spinach leaves) and CRM INCT-TL-1 (tea leaves) is investigated, as well as the repeatability in terms of recovery of metals from soil over a 3-week period by in vitro gastrointestinal extraction.},

	abstract = {Intensive prawn aquaculture in tropical regions is associated with high concentrations of total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) as a result of high rates of prawn excretion and feed loading. Excessive TAN can adversely effect productivity and result in adverse impacts on coastal waters. Cultures of indigenous nitrifying bacteria were enriched from intensive prawn aquaculture pond water using continuous and batch enrichment techniques. Cultures were capable of TAN removal over a wide range of initial TAN concentrations – up to 200 mg/l. Cultures were immobilized onto porous clay pellets to enhance cell density and applied to culture medium and TAN-augmented pond water under aerobic conditions to determine TAN removal proficiency. Immobilized cultures were able to achieve a high TAN removal proficiency in pond water – even at a low density of 0.1 pellet per liter. A concentration of less than 0.5 mg TAN/l could be maintained under a fed-batch condition of 3.2 mg TAN/l per day, after an initial 2-day lag phase. A simplified and effective culture enrichment process was developed for culture immobilization onto pellets using TAN-augmented pond water. Overall, pellet immobilization of indigenous nitrifying bacteria represents a potentially effective TAN control system for prawn aquaculture in low-cost, but intensive tropical prawn farms.},

This work studies Zn availability to earthworms from the ZnO (NP and bulk) applied to two agricultural soils with a different pH at 20, 225, 500, and 1000 mg Zn kg-1. Zn uptakes and the effects on Eisenia andrei, grown under controlled conditions, were determined. Effects were assessed at three levels: organisms, mortality, growth and reproduction; biochemical, catalase and glutathione S-transferase activities, malondialdehyde (MDA), and protein content; cellular in coelomocytes, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, lysosomal membrane alterations (RN) and mitochondrial dysfunction (MTT). Available Zn was 100-fold higher in acidic than in calcareous soil and did not differ among ZnO (NP or bulk). Zn in worms was auto-regulated regardless of the soil Zn concentration, pH and ZnO size. Effects on mortality and weight were observed only in the acidic soil at the highest concentration, ZnO NPs reduced survival and body weight, while ZnO bulk reduced body weight. Reproduction parameters in acidic soil were: EC50 (fecundity) 277 and 256 mg Zn kg-1 and EC50 (fertility) 177 and 179 mg Zn kg-1 for ZnO NPs and bulk, respectively, with no found NP-specific effects. No responses of enzymatic activities, MDA and MTT were detected. ROS and RN were altered in the coelomocyte cells of earthworms in the two soils, but effects depended on ZnO size suggesting nanospecific effects. Soil pH governs toxicity more than ZnO size regardless of body Zn concentration.},

We investigated water pollution, sediment contamination and the spread of diseases related to shrimp farming in the Can Gio district of Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam), an area representative for the impacts of intensive shrimp production in the country. Data on the production process was compiled from site observations, interviews with local farmers and experts, as well as from secondary sources. The results indicate that, while a large number of individual farms may exceed environmental standards, intensive shrimp farming is not always associated with waste streams exceeding water quality standards. This is interesting because it shows currently available technologies can reduce pollution from intensive shrimp farms. The paper concludes by identifying technologically and economically feasible options for reducing water pollution, problems associated with contaminated sediment, and the spread of diseases.},

	abstract = {The dual objective of sustainable aquaculture, i.e., to produce food while sustaining natural resources is achieved only when production systems with a minimum ecological impact are used. Recirculating aquaculture systems (RASs) provide opportunities to reduce water usage and to improve waste management and nutrient recycling. RAS makes intensive fish production compatible with environmental sustainability. This review aims to summarize the most recent developments within RAS that have contributed to the environmental sustainability of the European aquaculture sector. The review first shows the ongoing expansion of RAS production by species and country in Europe. Life cycle analysis showed that feed, fish production and waste and energy are the principal components explaining the ecological impact of RAS. Ongoing developments in RAS show two trends focusing on: (1) technical improvements within the recirculation loop and (2) recycling of nutrients through integrated farming. Both trends contributed to improvements in the environmental sustainability of RAS. Developments within the recirculation loop that are reviewed are the introduction of denitrification reactors, sludge thickening technologies and the use of ozone. New approached towards integrated systems include the incorporation of wetlands and algal controlled systems in RAS. Finally, the review identifies the key research priorities that will contribute to the future reduction of the ecological impact of RAS. Possible future breakthroughs in the fields of waste production and removal might further enhance the sustainabilty of fish production in RAS.},

However, their high energy requirement is a drawback, which increases both operational costs and the potential impacts created by the use of fossil fuels. Energy use in RAS has been studied indirectly and/or mentioned in several publications. Nevertheless, its importance and impacts have not been studied. In aiming to achieve economic and environmentally sustainable production a compromise has to be found between water use, waste discharge, energy consumption and productivity. The current review discusses published studies about energy use and RAS designs efficiencies. Moreover, with the aim of making an industry baseline study a survey about the energy use in commercial scale RAS was conducted. The design of more efficient and less energy dependent RAS is presented, including optimized unit processes, system integration and equipment selection. The main conclusions are: fossil based fuels are less cost-effective than renewable energies; energy is of little concern for the majority of the industry, and renewable energies are of potential use in RAS.},

The capability of biochar to immobilise and retain arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) from a multi-element contaminated sediment-derived soil was explored by a column leaching experiment and scanning electron microanalysis (SEM/EDX). Sorption of Cd and Zn to biochar’s surfaces assisted a 300 and 45-fold reduction in their leachate concentrations, respectively. Retention of both metals was not affected by considerable leaching of water-soluble carbon from biochar, and could not be reversed following subsequent leaching of the sorbant biochar with water at pH 5.5. Weakly water-soluble As was also retained on biochar’s surface but leachate concentrations did not duly decline. It is concluded that biochar can rapidly reduce the mobility of selected contaminants in this polluted soil system, with especially encouraging results for Cd.},

This book provides an authoritative account of the development of the modern pesticides industry. It discusses the emergence of major pesticide companies such as Bayer, Monsanto, Rhone Poulenc, Dow, DuPont, Ciba-Geigy, Syngenta, BASF and ICI. It covers their competitive strategies such as product development, mergers/acquisitions and diversification. Individual company strategies are placed in the context of broader developments in agriculture which have driven the evolution of the industry, from the Pre-Productionist period to the contemporary world of Post-Productivism and the Sustainability Paradigm. It also reviews how companies have responded to changing national and international policy towards the role of pesticides in agriculture and efforts to regulate their use.This book will be a standard reference on understanding the growth structure, dynamics and major players in a hugely-important and influential sector in global agriculture. It will appeal to a wide range of readers, from policy makers and researchers in crop protection to financial and investment analysts focussed on agriculture, and to all those interested in the development and future of modern agriculture.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is the backbone of society as it mainly functions to provide food, feed and fiber on which all human depends to live. Precision agriculture is implemented with a goal to apply sufficient treatments at the right place in the right time with the purpose to provide low-input, high efficiency and sustainable agricultural production. In precision agriculture, automation and robotics have become one of the main frameworks which focusing on minimizing environmental impact and simultaneously maximizing agricultural produce. The application of automation and robotics in precision agriculture is essentially implemented for precise farm management by using modern technologies. In the past decades, a significant amount of research has focused on the applications of mobile robot for agricultural operations such as planting, inspection, spraying and harvesting. This paper reviews the recent applications of automation and robotics in agriculture in the past five years. In this paper, the recent implementations are divided into four categories which indicates different operations executed for planting management starting from a seed until the product is ready to be harvested. Towards the end of this paper, several challenges and suggestions are described to indicate the opportunities and improvements that can be made in designing an efficient autonomous and robotics system for agricultural applications. Based on the conducted review, different operations have different challenges thus require diverse solutions to solve the specific operational problem. Therefore, the development process of an efficient autonomous agricultural robotic system must consider all possibilities and challenges in different types of agricultural operation to minimize system errors during future implementation. In addition, the development cost needs to be fully considered to ensure that the farmers will be able to invest their capital as a consumer. Therefore, it will become highly possible for the autonomous agricultural robotic system to be widely implemented throughout the world in the future.},

	abstract = {In recent years, urban agriculture (UA) projects have bloomed throughout the world, ﬁnding large applications also in the developed economies of the so-called Global North. As compared to projects in developing countries, where research has mainly targeted the contribution to food security, UA in the Global North has a stronger multifunctional connotation, and results in multiple combinations of farming purposes and business models pursued. The present review paper explores the contribution and role that UA plays in cities from the Global North, deﬁning its functionalities toward ecosystem services (ES) provisioning and analyzing the factors that hinders and promote its regional diffusion and uptake. The manuscript integrates a description of UA growing systems, as well opportunities for crop diversiﬁcation in the urban environment, and a comprehensive classiﬁcation of UA business models. The distinctive features in terms of business models, farming purposes and farm size are then applied over an inventory of 470 UA projects in the Global North, allowing for a characterization and comparative analysis of distribution frequency of the different project typologies.},

A deeper understanding of the complex ways roots interact with soils is making it possible to ‘design’ roots to optimise nutrient/water uptake in low-input environments, as well as deliver other benefits such as improved soil health and reduced nutrient leaching. Continued research is needed in this important area so that it can contribute to more sustainable, ‘climate-smart’ crop production.Understanding and improving crop root function features authoritative reviews of current research in all aspects of root science, including root growth regulators, root anatomy, nutrient acquisition and root system architecture. This collection discusses the responses of plant roots to abiotic and biotic stresses and how understanding nutrient uptake can be exploited to optimise root function. The book concludes with a dedicated section on methods used to improve crop root function and crop nutrient use efficiency, such as the use of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR).With its eminent editor and international array of expert authors, Understanding and improving crop root function will be a standard reference for university researchers in crop physiology and nutrition, government and other agencies supporting agriculture, companies supplying crop nutrition products and services, as well as farmers.},

	abstract = {Background Nowadays a significant extension of lands contaminated with toxic elements is being used for agriculture, posing a serious risk of crop contamination and toxicity. Several methodologies are being used to remediate soil contamination, including the use of amendments such as biochar. In this work, we evaluated the effects of biochar, combined with different fertirrigations (water, a conventional fertilizer solution, or a fertilizer solution with a commercial biostimulant derived from leonardite) on the availability of toxic elements and nutrients for pepper cultivated in a soil contaminated with As, Cd, Pb and Zn. Results Irrigation with fertilizer solutions improved plant growth regardless biochar amendment. Biochar decreased biovailability of Cu and Pb in soil and Cu content in pepper leaves. Combined with fertilization, biochar also decreased plant As and Pb contents. Biochar combined with biostimulant decreased the bioavailable content of Cd in soil and its uptake by pepper plants. Conclusion The use of biochar and biostimulant posed advantages for plant production in a non-suitable scenario of nutrient scarcity and contamination. This article is protected by copyright.

	abstract = {This study investigated the potential of biochar ﬁlters as a replacement or complement for sand ﬁlters for removal of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) from wastewater in onsite sewage facilities (OSSF). Speciﬁcally, the study investigated the effects of biodegradation, adsorption and a combination of these processes on removal of four model PhACs from wastewater in biochar ﬁlters operated under hydraulic loading conditions mimicking those found in onsite inﬁltration beds. Concentrations and removal of the four PhACs (i.e. carbamazepine, metoprolol, ranitidine and caffeine) were investigated over 22 weeks in four treatments: biochar (BC) with active or inactive bioﬁlm (BC-active-bioﬁlm, BC-inactive-bioﬁlm), biochar without bioﬁlm (BC-no-bioﬁlm) and sand with active bioﬁlm (Sand-active-bioﬁlm). The adsorption of carbamazepine was high in BC-no-bioﬁlm (99\% removal after 22 weeks), while biodegradation was very low in Sand-active-bioﬁlm (7\% removal after 22 weeks). Removal of carbamazepine in BC-active-bioﬁlm was high and stable over the 22 weeks (N 98\%), showing a signiﬁcant role of bioﬁlm in ﬁlter biogeneration. However, carbamazepine removal declined over time in BC-inactive-bioﬁlm, from 99\% in week 13 to 73\% in week 22. Metoprolol was poorly degraded in Sand-active-bioﬁlm (37\% after 22 weeks), while adsorption seemed to be the major pathway for removal of metoprolol in biochar. Ranitidine and caffeine were efﬁciently removed by either adsorption (97\% and 98\%, respectively, after 22 weeks) or biodegradation (99\% and N 99\%, respectively, after 22 weeks). In conclusion, biochar is a promising ﬁlter medium for OSSF, especially for persistent PhACs such as carbamazepine and metoprolol.},

	abstract = {The removal of crop residues for bio‐energy production reduces the formation of soil organic carbon (SOC) and therefore can have negative impacts on soil fertility. Pyrolysis (thermoconversion of biomass under anaerobic conditions) generates liquid or gaseous fuels and a char (biochar) recalcitrant against decomposition. Biochar can be used to increase SOC and cycle nutrients back into agricultural fields. In this case, crop residues can be used as a potential energy source as well as to sequester carbon (C) and improve soil quality. To evaluate the agronomic potential of biochar, we analyzed biochar produced from poultry litter, peanut hulls, and pine chips produced at 400°C and 500°C with or without steam activation. The C content of the biochar ranged from 40\% in the poultry litter (PL) biochar to 78\% in the pine chip (PC) biochar. The total and Mehlich I extractable nutrient concentrations in the biochar were strongly influenced by feedstock. Feedstock nutrients (P, K, Ca, Mg) were concentrated in the biochar and were significantly higher in the biochars produced at 500°C. A large proportion of N was conserved in the biochar, ranging from 27.4\% in the PL biochar to 89.6\% in the PC biochar. The amount of N conserved was inversely proportional to the feedstock N concentration. The cation exchange capacity was significantly higher in biochar produced at lower temperature. The results indicate that, depending on feedstock, some biochars have potential to serve as nutrient sources as well as sequester C.},

	abstract = {Granular wood-derived biochar (BC) was compared to granular activated carbon (GAC) for the treatment and nutrient recovery of real wastewater in both batch and column studies. Batch adsorption studies showed that BC material had a greater adsorption capacity at the high initial concentrations of total chemical oxygen demand (COD-T) (1200 mg LÀ1), PO4 (18 mg LÀ1), and NH4 (50 mg LÀ1) compared to GAC. Conversely the BC material showed a lower adsorption capacity for all concentrations of dissolved chemical oxygen demand (COD-D) and the lower concentrations of PO4 (5 mg LÀ1) and NH4 (10 mg LÀ1). Packed bed column studies showed similar average COD-T removal rate for BC with 0.27 ± 0.01 kg mÀ3 dÀ1 and GAC with 0.24 ± 0.01 kg mÀ3 dÀ1, but BC had nearly twice the average removal rate (0.41 ± 0.08 kg mÀ3 dÀ3) compared to GAC during high COD-T concentrations ({\textgreater}500 mg LÀ1). Elemental analysis showed that both materials accumulated phosphorous during wastewater treatment (2.6 ± 0.4 g kgÀ1 and 1.9 ± 0.1 g kgÀ1 for BC and GAC respectively). They also contained high concentrations of other macronutrients (K, Ca, and Mg) and low concentrations of metals (As, Cd, Cr, Pb, Zn, and Cu). The good performance of BC is attributed to its macroporous structure compared with the microporous GAC. These favorable treatment data for high strength wastewater, coupled with additional lifecycle beneﬁts, helps support the use of BC in packed bed column ﬁlters for enhanced wastewater treatment and nutrient recovery.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate membrane filtration (MF) as an alternative, or complimentary, treatment to UV irradiation for pathogen control in RAS, as well as examine the operation and cost of each treatment. In a pilot-scale RAS, both MF and UV were used to treat wastewater for 30 days and water samples were collected biweekly and analysed for culturable bacteria, suspended solids, UV transmittance and other parameters. Bacterial control efficiencies were similar between both MF and UV treatments, which removed 99\% of total bacteria and 98\% of heterotrophic bacteria, respectively. Surface fouling was negligible for the UV while MF required biweekly cleaning to maintain operation. However, MF had the additional benefit of removing 96\% of suspended solids, which resulted in increased UV transmittance. Capital and operating costs of MF were similar to UV, but only when MF treated a fraction of the wastewater compared with UV. We conclude that MF represents a potential complimentary technology to enhance UV irradiation, especially to minimise pathogens in RAS that are shielded by particles or tolerate UV.},

            In dry areas, the need for irrigation to ensure agricultural production determines the use of all available water sources. However, the water sources used for irrigation are often contaminated by untreated or minimally treated wastewater. Microbial risks from reusing wastewater for vegetable irrigation can be addressed by installing environmental barriers that pathogens must cross to reach humans in the reuse system. Knowledge of pathogen flows inside the system and pathogen removal potential is the first step towards devising a risk management strategy. This study assessed microbe prevalence in farming systems in the Bolivian highlands that use wastewater-polluted sources for irrigation of lettuce. Samples of soil, lettuce and different water sources used in the farming systems were taken during one crop season and concentrations of coliphages, Escherichia coli and helminth eggs were measured. The results showed high spread of these microorganisms throughout the whole system. There was a significant correlation between microbial quality of water and of the harvested produce for several microorganisms. The microbial prevalence in protected shallow wells was found to be significantly lower than in other water sources. These findings can help formulate feasible risk management strategies in contexts where conventional technologies for microbial removal are not possible.},

Rice husk includes biomass that can be exploited for various requirements such as industrial raw materials as well as energy sources or fuel but only a small group of people use it. This research is conducted utilizing the rice husk as an alternative fuel by making it as a charcoal briquette. To make the treatment easy, firstly the rice husk biomass was converted into charcoal powder by carbonization method using two kinds of furnace which have different heating behavior. The best carbonization results are obtained from the furnace, which has a constant temperature heating behavior. The process of making briquettes is prepared by adding tapioca starch of 6\% concentration by weight as charcoal adhesive and then printed with the aid of pressing tools using loads at 1,000 kg/cm2. The resulting briquette has a calorific value about 3.126 cal/g, mass density is 0.86 g/cm3 and compressive strength is about 2.02 kg/cm2, so that the bio-briquette of charcoal produced can be used as alternative energy to replace the fossil fuel for domestic or household purposes.},

	abstract = {Extensive use of biochar to mitigate N2O emission is limited by the lack of understanding on the exact mechanisms altering N2O emissions from biochar-amended soils. Biochars produced from giant reed were characterized and used to investigate their inﬂuence on N2O emission. Responses of N2O emission varied with pyrolysis temperature, and the reduction order of N2O emission by biochar (BC) was: BC200 z BC600 {\textgreater} BC500 z BC300 z BC350 {\textgreater} BC400. The reduced emission was attributed to enhanced N immobilization and decreased denitriﬁcation in the biochar-amended soils. The remaining polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in low-temperature biochars (300e400 C) played a major role in reducing N2O emission, but not for high-temperature biochars (500e600 C). Removal of phenolic compounds from low-temperature (200e400 C) biochars resulted in a surprising reduction of N2O emission, but the mechanism is still unknown. Overall, adding giant reed biochars could reduce N2O evolution from agricultural soil, thus possibly mitigating global warming.},

The alkalinity and pH of the biochars increased with increased pyrolysis temperature. The X-ray diffraction spectra and the content of carbonates of the biochars suggested that carbonates were the major alkaline components in the biochars generated at the high temperature; they were also responsible for the strong buffer plateau-regions on the acid–base titration curves at 500 and 700 °C. The data of FTIR–PAS and zeta potentials indicated that the functional groups such as –COOÀ (–COOH) and –OÀ (–OH) contained by the biochars contributed greatly to the alkalinity of the biochar samples tested, especially for those generated at the lower temperature. These functional groups were also responsible for the negative charges of the biochars.},

	title = {Nitrogen {Removal} from {Closed} {Aquaculture} {System} by {Bio}-electrochemical {System}},
	abstract = {Removal of nitrogen elements in culture water is one of the major concerns in recirculating aquaculture system (RAS). Maintaining a low concentration of nitrogen compounds is essential for a good quality of aquaculture production. Due to fish is very sensitive to the toxic ammonium/ammonia, nitrification biofiltration tank is often an integrate part of filtration in RAS to remove ammonium via nitrification. However, nitrate accumulation via nitrification in RAS is often observed during the operation, which is usually solved by replacing with the fresh water into the system. With the concern of water consumption, bio-electrochemical system (BES) was introduced in this study to realize simultaneous nitrate removal for the system while generating the electricity through electron transferring. A microbial fuel cell (MFC) with an anion exchange membrane (AEM) was constructed. The removal of nitrate from aquaculture water generated from RAS was achieved by nitrate migration across the AEM and heterotrophic denitrification in the anode chamber. To further investigate the potential application of BES in RAS, the cathode chamber was incubated with biofilm to do the nitrification while the denitrification processing in the anode chamber. The study gave a total inorganic nitrogen removal efficiency of 38.72\% ± 4.99, and a COD removal of 86.09\% ±9.83. The average daily electricity generation was 67.98 A m-3 ±13.91, and nitrate-nitrogen concentration remained at 21.02 ±2.62 mg L-1 throughout the experiment. These results of treating aquaculture water indicate that BES has a potential to install within RAS for enhanced nitrogen removal.},

	abstract = {Maintaining low concentrations of nitrogen compounds in aquaculture water is a key requirement for recirculating aquaculture system (RAS), due to the potential detrimental effects of ammonia or nitrate on fish growth and metabolic activities. Herein, a microbial fuel cell (MFC) was investigated to accomplish the removal of either nitrate or ammonia from real RAS water (with simulated daily nitrate/ammonium accumulation) while generating electricity, via aerobic nitrification in the cathode, electricity/concentration driven transport across anion exchange membrane, and subsequent heterotrophic denitrification in the anode chamber. The experiment went through two stages, nitrate removal (Stage I) and ammonia removal (Stage II). In Stage I when daily nitrate addition was performed to mimic nitrate accumulation (0.050 kg NO3--N m-3 NCC d-1, NCC: net cathodic chamber volume) in the MFC cathode, a stable current density of 12.48 A m-3 could be achieved with a 73.3\% nitrate removal and 91.3\% COD removal at the end of day 15. To better mimic ammonium accumulation in the RAS effluent without a biofilter, daily ammonium addition (0.050 kg NH4+-N m-3 NCC d-1) was performed in the cathode in Stage II. The MFC system achieved a total inorganic nitrogen removal rate of 0.051 kg N m-3 NCC d-1, and a COD removal efficiency of 91.8 \% with a current density of 74.00 A m-3. A preliminary analysis of energy balance indicated that the proposed MFC could potentially achieve energypositive RAS water treatment with a net energy production of 7.50 × 10-3 kWh m-3 treated RAS water or 0.145 ± 0.031 kWh kg-1 removed nitrogen. The results of this study indicate that MFCs have a potential to treat RAS water with simultaneous energy recovery.},

Biochars, with excellent capacity to remove several contaminants from aqueous solutions, constitute an untapped technology for drinking water treatment. Biochar water treatment has several potential merits compared to existing low-cost methods (i.e., sand ﬁltration, boiling, solar disinfection, chlorination): (1) biochar is a low-cost and renewable adsorbent made using readily available biomaterials and skills, making it appropriate for low-income communities; (2) existing methods predominantly remove pathogens, but biochars remove chemical, biological and physical contaminants; (3) biochars maintain organoleptic properties of water, while existing methods generate carcinogenic by-products (e.g., chlorination) and/or increase concentrations of chemical contaminants (e.g., boiling). Biochars have co-beneﬁts including provision of clean energy for household heating and cooking, and soil application of spent biochar improves soil quality and crop yields. Integrating biochar into the water and sanitation system transforms linear material ﬂows into looped material cycles, consistent with terra preta sanitation. Lack of design information on biochar water treatment, and environmental and public health risks constrain the biochar technology. Seven hypotheses for future research are highlighted under three themes: (1) design and optimization of biochar water treatment; (2) ecotoxicology and human health risks associated with contaminant transfer along the biochar-soilfood-human pathway, and (3) life cycle analyses of carbon and energy footprints of biochar water treatment systems.},

The digested residue and fresh bagasse was pyrolyzed separately into biochar at 600 °C in nitrogen environment. The digested bagasse biochar (DBC) and undigested bagasse biochar (BC) were characterized to determine their physicochemical properties. Although biochar was produced from the digested residue (18\% by weight) and the raw bagasse (23\%) at a similar rate, there were many physiochemical differences between them. Compared to BC, DBC had higher pH, surface area, cation exchange capacity (CEC), anion exchange capacity (AEC), hydrophobicity and more negative surface charge, all properties that are generally desirable for soil amelioration, contaminant remediation or wastewater treatment. Thus, these results suggest that the pyrolysis of anaerobic digestion residues to produce biochar may be an economically and environmentally beneﬁcial use of agricultural wastes.},

The effect of water of low salinity with different ion content on the growth and survival of shrimp was determined. First, water was extracted from 4 wells with a depth of 5 to 7 m, located in Sinaloa River Basin in Guasave, Mexico at: (T1) 25.43°N, 108.44°W; (T2) 25.48°N, 108.37°W; (T3) 25.60°N, 108.40°W and (T4) 25.64°N, 108.51°W and were selected on base the different ionic water composition. The experimental design was 4 independent treatments with 3 replicate. Shrimp were grown at sea water (Tm= 34 ± 1.4 g L-1) used as a control. Shrimps grown in Tm and T1 had averaged weight (over 12 ± 0.61 g) and survival rates (78\%), with statistical differences to others low salinity water treatments. The condition factor obtained with low-salinity water (T1= 0.654) was like that recorded for Tm (0.670), where ionic ratios (Na/K and Mg/K) were similar to that of seawater. This observation strongly suggests that the ratios of the major ions (Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+) play a relevant role for development of organisms under cultivation. Shrimp cultured in water of low salinity with an ionic ratio similar to that of sea water were organisms with the best development under cultivation, therefore indicating that the proportion of major ions were important for shrimp.},

Shrimp postlarvae were acclimated from seawater (30 g L À 1) to low-salinity well water (o1.0 g L À 1) at a constant hourly reduction rate of 40, 60, 80 and 100 h. After acclimation to low-salinity well water, postlarvae from each acclimation time treatment were stocked in three replicate tanks at densities of 50, 100, 150 or 200 shrimps m À 2 for 12 weeks of growth. Salinity averaged o1.0 g L À 1 for each growth study. The di¡erent treatments resulted in signi¢cant di¡erences in both the ¢nal body weight and the survival rate (SR). Shrimp acclimated for 100 h showed substantially improved survival (83\%) relative to shrimp acclimated for shorter periods. Shrimp yields for all cultured periods ranged from 0.32 kg m À 2 in tanks stocked at 50 m À 2 to 1.14 kg m À 2 in tanks stocked at 200 m À 2. We conclude that whiteleg shrimp can be successfully grown in low-salinity well water, and that the growth, production output and SRs are signi¢cantly higher when shrimp are acclimated for longer periods.},

Striped catfish sludge was collected from four commercial ponds along the Mekong river and from three indoor RAS. The amount of sludge dry matter produced per kilogram of fish in ponds was 6 times higher than that in RAS. However, the concentration of nutrients in solid waste from RAS was much higher, with better compost quality and higher methane yield than that of sludge from ponds. Out of the collected 381 L biogas, the methane yield of striped catfish’s solid waste in RAS systems was 201 L per kg chemical oxygen demand (COD). In ponds, the collected 267 L biogas yielded 125 L CH4 per kg COD. The higher methane production from RAS sludge concurred with higher digestibility of COD: 58\% for RAS versus 38\% for ponds. The quality and quantity of methane from striped catfish sludge were lower than that for other animal manures, and the resulting electricity yield was low. Considering the higher nutrient concentration in RAS-sludge, we recommend the combination RAS and composting in reusing sludge, which is presently the best option for a more sustainable and cleaner striped catfish production system.},

These systems allow for a significant degree of control and management in a biosecure manner. However, it is still unclear as to what type of production system is best suited for indoor whiteleg shrimp nurseries. This study evaluated and compared clean-water recirculating aquaculture system (CW-RAS), photo-heterotrophic (PT), and biofloc technology (BFT) systems in terms of water quality, growth performance, and production costs of whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei at three stocking densities (500, 1000 and 1500 org/m3) for 35 d in the nursery phase. In this study, twenty-seven, 100-L circular plastic tanks (microcosm) were randomly assigned to one of the treatments and stored with postlarvae shrimps (0.016 g). Throughout the experiment, water quality parameters remained within acceptable ranges for whiteleg shrimp growth. High concentrations of total ammonia-nitrogen (TAN) were determined in the CW-RAS system and nitrates and nitrites in the BFT system. Furthermore, the growth parameters showed significant differences (P {\textless} 0.05) between the treatments; higher values in PT and BFT systems at 500 org/m3 and lower survival in the CW-RAS system. These results suggest that a dense-dependent effect was observed from 1000 org/m3 onwards. In general, postlarvae, feed, labor and energy accounted for higher costs. The study findings further indicate that CW-RAS had the highest production costs for 1000 juveniles.},

The inﬂuence of physicochemical properties such as mineral content, surface functionality, pH and cation exchange capacity has been investigated for a range of biochars and hydrochars produced from waste-derived biomass feedstocks. Hydrochars produced from hydrothermal carbonisation at 250 C have been compared to low and high temperature pyrolysis chars produced at 400 e450 C and 600e650 C respectively for oak wood, presscake from anaerobic digestate (AD), treated municipal waste and greenhouse waste. In spite of differences in char physicochemical properties and processing conditions, PO4eP and NH4eN sorption capacities ranged from about 0 to 30 mg gÀ1 and 105.8e146.4 mg gÀ1 respectively. Chars with high surface areas did not possess better ammonium adsorption capacities than low surface area chars, which suggests that surface area is not the most important factor inﬂuencing char ammonium adsorption capacity, while char calcium and magnesium contents may inﬂuence phosphate adsorption. Desorption experiments only released a small fraction of adsorbed ammonium or phosphate ({\textless}5 mg gÀ1 and a maximum of 8.5 mg gÀ1 respectively).},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to evaluate the development of intensive shrimp farming in land – based ponds and its production and management. This study was carried out in traditional growth ponds of the farmers in Pankep regency, South Sulawesi. There were seven ponds used for shrimp growth with intensive system such as used of high quality feed, seed, probiotic bacteria, intensive aeration, minerals and vitamine. Shrimp growth ponds used intensively culture system with profile condition as follows : (1) water depth of ponds, 120 150 cm, feeding rate four times a day, water quality parameters were measured every day for, water temperature, pH, salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO). Average daily gain (ADG), Survival rate (SR), Feed conversion ratio (FCR) and MBW were measured every week. Stocking density every ponds was different, 49 - 56 idividuals/m2. Feeding process was conducted four times a day: 08.00 am, 10.00 am. 14.00 p.m. 16.00 p.m. Culture periods were different per ponds between 105 - 112 days. All ponds used zero water exchange system and addition water from well for change loss water by evaporation. The results of this study showed that shrimp production, 1,778 - 3,664 kg; FCR: 1.28 - 1.4; ADG : 0.22 - 0.31; MBW 21 - 23, water temperature, 29 - 34 0C; pH 7.6 - 8.6; dissolved oxygen, 2.6 - 6.1 mg/L. Salinity 13 - 22 ppt. Water depth with range, 100- 130 cm, survival rate (SR) 88 - 91 \% and shrimp size in the final culture period average 43 individuals/m2. In summary, Water quality parameters such DO, temperature, salinity, pH and others were in range suitable for shrimp growth and its productivity was 8,800 kg/ha. This study has benefit for shrimp growth performance, feed efficiency utilization and productivity significantly improve.},

	abstract = {The spatial organization of complex natural microbiomes is critical to understanding the interactions of the individual taxa that comprise a community. Although the revolution in DNA sequencing has provided an abundance of genomic-level information, the biogeography of microbiomes is almost entirely uncharted at the micron scale. Using spectral imaging fluorescence in situ hybridization as guided by metagenomic sequence analysis, we have discovered a distinctive, multigenus consortium in the microbiome of supragingival dental plaque. The consortium consists of a radially arranged, nine-taxon structure organized around cells of filamentous corynebacteria. The consortium ranges in size from a few tens to a few hundreds of microns in radius and is spatially differentiated. Within the structure, individual taxa are localized at the micron scale in ways suggestive of their functional niche in the consortium. For example, anaerobic taxa tend to be in the interior, whereas facultative or obligate aerobes tend to be at the periphery of the consortium. Consumers and producers of certain metabolites, such as lactate, tend to be near each other. Based on our observations and the literature, we propose a model for plaque microbiome development and maintenance consistent with known metabolic, adherence, and environmental considerations. The consortium illustrates how complex structural organization can emerge from the micron-scale interactions of its constituent organisms. The understanding that plaque community organization is an emergent phenomenon offers a perspective that is general in nature and applicable to other microbiomes.},

	title = {Biology of {White} {Leg} {Shrimp}, \textit{{Penaeus} vannamei}: {Review}},
	abstract = {Shrimp aquaculture plays a significant role in the world economy. According to the information of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, marine and brackish water shrimp culture productions have expanded from less than 10, 000 metric tonnes in 1970 more than 4, 000, 000 metric tonnes in 2014. The most of the aquaculture shrimp contribution has come from Penaeus vannamei which accounts 80\% of the whole shrimp production. Although the cultivated shrimp production has rapidly increased during these years, the annual economic losses due to disease were estimated to be approximately 1 billion US dollar per year since the early 1990s. Viruses and bacteria mainly cause the diseases of the shrimp. Hence, most of the published reviews focused on the diseases and production aspects of P. vannamei. However, the biology of this species is neglected during the last two decades. For better production and health management systems of this species, it is paramount to have basic and solid knowledge of the biology of P. vannamei. However, there are limited reviews available on the biology of P. vannamei. This is, thus, we are very motivated to review of the biology of the shrimp for efficient health management and production of the shrimp. The life cycle of this species is very complex and it usually takes around 1.5 years to complete the whole life cycle of P.vannamei. The external morphology of P.vannamei is well described and understood. We also highlighted the basic internal morphology and physiology of this species. There is limited information on the understanding of natural behaviour and feeding habits of this animal. Therefore, further studies are needed in future to have solid knowledge of internal morphology and physiology, natural behaviour and feeding habits of P. vannamei in order to improve the production and health management systems.},

For improving the knowledge about this issue several instrumental techniques were used in the present study to analyse the physical and chemical changes as a function of vermicomposting time of banana stem waste (BS) spiked with cow dung (CD) in different proportions using earthworm Eisenia fetida. Chemical analysis by ICP-AES showed gradual increase in the plant nutrients (P, Ca, K, Mg, Fe) up to 60 day of vermicomposting in all the treatments. But among different treatments, K, Mg and Fe were considerably higher in the BS2CD1 blend. The FTIR showed strong NO stretching vibration with increasing BS content signifying the presence of nitrate in the final compost. The TG analysis of final BS-CD composts described the lower mass loss (52–55\%) in the final compared to the initial stage due to high level of humification by earthworms. The maturity of the final compost was confirmed by DSC analysis which exhibited lowering of relative intensity of exothermic peaks related to the easily degradable material at 320–330 °C and complex organic moieties at 495–530 °C. Decrease in the humification index (Q4/6, Q2/4, Q2/6) at 60 day confirmed the stability of vermicomposts. All the treatments showed {\textless}2 mg CO2-C g−1 vermicompost C day−1 respiration rates and {\textgreater}70\% germination indices (GI) for rice and pea seeds. These findings defined a clear comparison between the treatments during vermicomposting in terms of stability and maturity and revealed that BS2CD1 can be utilized as nutrient-rich stable compost for enhanced crop production.},

	abstract = {The main residues generated from the sugarcane industry, in Egypt, are green tops and dry leaves from the harvesting process as well as bagasse, filter cake/mud and furnace ash from the cane milling process. The green tops are directly fed to the farmers’ livestock in its raw form during the sugar harvesting season which is from January to April. As for the dry leaves, it represents a burden due to its large volume and fire hazard and so it is daily burnt in the fields causing considerable air pollution. Bagasse, on the other hand, is currently used in Egyptian sugar mills as fuel to generate the mill’s steam and electricity or as fiber to make fiberboard and paper. However, as natural gas is replacing bagasse as fuel, bagasse will be available in large quantities in the factories that are not currently utilizing it for fiber. In addition, filter cake/mud and furnace ash are currently applied directly on reclaimed lands to act as soil additive. However, direct incorporation of raw agro-industrial waste into the soil may cause undesirable outcomes as phytotoxicity and soil nitrogen immobilization. The objective of this research was to test for the possibility and feasibility of producing compost/organic fertilizer from the waste streams generated from the agricultural and industrial phases of sugarcane manufacture, as an environmentally friendly reuse alternative to produce organic fertilizer that is more safe and environmental friendly than chemical or artificial fertilizers. The pilot experiment has demonstrated that a variety of compost types and organic fertilizers can be produced from a combination of the residues generated from the sugarcane residues according to their chemical and biological properties.},

Giving compost from the results of the utilization of the byproducts of sugarcane processing in the form of bagasse and filter mud is expected to increase the sugarcane productivity. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of compost from the sugarcane bagasse, filter mud and cow manure using the decomposer and Trico Plus mushroom consortium on the growth and production of sugarcane. The experiment was carried out in the form of a randomized block design consisting of eight treatments and three replications. Each treatment was applied as much as 15 tons per hectare, NPK basic fertilizer for all 350 kg treatments per hectare. The results showed that the treatment of compost provides a higher number of sugarcane saplings compared to without the provision of compost. The compost C treatment gave the highest number of sugarcane saplings and the highest number of segments of 7.45 sugarcane saplings and 18.33 segments. Treatment G gave the highest plant height of 283.30 cm, treatment B gave the highest segment length of 15.17 cm, stem diameter of 2.62 cm, stem height of 163.00 cm, sugarcane stem weight of 158.36 kg per plot and 97.655 tons per hectare and POL value 31.32\% while treatment E gave the highest Briks value of 23.43\%. G treatment gave the best plant height value of 283.30 cm. Giving compost from the results of mixing bagasse, filter mud and manure using the mushroom and Trico Plus consortiums gave better results on growth, and production of sugar cane compared to without the provision of compost.},

Sugar-distillery complexes, integrating the production of cane sugar and ethanol, constitute one of the key agro-based industries. There are presently nearly 500 sugar factories in the country along with around 300 molasses based alcohol distilleries. These include sugarcane trash, bagasse, pressmud and bagasse fly ash. Composting is an efficient method of waste disposal, enabling recycling of organic matter. Composting is one of the most promising technologies for solid waste treatment. The organic substrates in solid waste can be biodegraded and stabilized by composting and the final compost products could be applied to land as the fertilizer or soil conditioner. The present review paper deals with the following topics: Composting, Composting of pollutants and various industrial wastes, Physical and chemical nature of raw pressmud, Biochemical changes during composting, Microbial enzymes and composting, Factors controlling composting and Characteristics of the compost and its application in agriculture.},

Physicochemical and microbial stability of these substrates might be enhanced with the addition of biochar. A series of experiments was carried out to determine the stability of microbe populations in both worm castings and sugarcane filter mud compost with the addition of biochar made from sugarcane bagasse. Storage studies up to 150 days were carried out with biochar/worm castings and biochar/sugarcane filter mud compost blends on a volume basis (100/0; 90/10; 75/25; 50/50; 25/75; 10/90; 0/100). Physico-chemical properties, such as micro and macro nutrient composition, pH, ash and carbon contents, amongst others were monitored throughout storage time as well as microbe counts. No major deleterious effects to the microbial population were found by adding biochar to either substrate, despite decreasing moisture levels for increased biochar additions. Biochar might be providing nutrients needed by microbes, as well as possibly bind bacterial waste products that would otherwise be toxic to the microbe population. Larger scale studies are warranted as well as longer storage time to optimize shelf stability.},

	abstract = {Soil is a base of structure, which actually supports the structure from beneath and distributes the load effectively. If the stability of the soil is not adequate then failure of structure occurs in form of settlement, cracks etc. Expansive soil also known as black cotton soil is more responsible for such situations and this is due to presence of montmorillonite mineral in it, which has ability to undergo large swelling and shrinkage. To overcome this, properties of soil must be improved by artificial means known as ‘Soil Stabilization’. It is a technique which improvises one or more soil properties by mechanical, cementing and chemical use. Many research has been conducted for stabilization of soil by using cementing, chemical materials e.g. Fly ash, cement, Calcium chloride, Sodium chloride etc. Toady world is facing serious problem of disposal of agricultural waste. Western Maharashtra is popular for production of sugar cane in large quantity. Sugar factories produces waste after extraction of sugar cane in machines that waste when burnt, the resultant ash is known as ‘Bagasse Ash’. It is a fibrous material with presence of silica (SiO2) and can be used to improve the existing properties of black cotton soil. In this study laboratory experiments were conducted on black cotton soil with partial replacement by Bagasse Ash (3\%, 6\%, 9\% and 12\%). This paper highlights significant increase in properties of black cotton soil obtained at 6\% replacement of Bagasse Ash without any chemical or cementing material.},

A concept map typically represents ideas and information as boxes or circles, which it connects with labeled arrows, often in a downward-branching hierarchical structure. The relationship between concepts can be articulated in linking phrases such as "causes", "requires", "such as" or "contributes to".The technique for visualizing these relationships among different concepts is called concept mapping. Concept maps have been used to define the ontology of computer systems, for example with the object-role modeling or Unified Modeling Language formalism.},

	abstract = {A personal knowledge base (PKB) is an electronic tool used to express, capture, and later retrieve the personal knowledge of an individual. It differs from a traditional database in that it contains subjective material particular to the owner, that others may not agree with nor care about. Importantly, a PKB consists primarily of knowledge, rather than information; in other words, it is not a collection of documents or other sources an individual has encountered, but rather an expression of the distilled knowledge the owner has extracted from those sources.The term personal knowledge base was mentioned as early as the 1980s, but the term came to prominence when it was described at length in publications by computer scientist Stephen Davies and colleagues, who compared PKBs on a number of different dimensions, the most important of which is the data model that each PKB uses to organize knowledge.Davies and colleagues examined three aspects of the data models of PKBs:

their structural framework, which prescribes rules about how knowledge elements can be structured and interrelated (as a tree, graph, tree plus graph, spatially, categorically, or as n-ary links);
their knowledge elements, or basic building blocks of information that a user creates and works with, and the level of granularity of those knowledge elements (such as word/concept, phrase/proposition, free text notes, links to information sources, or composite); and
their schema, which involves the level of formal semantics introduced into the data model (such as a type system and related schemas, keywords, attribute–value pairs, etc.).Davies and colleagues also differentiated PKBs according to their architecture: file-based, database-based, or client–server systems (including Internet-based systems accessed through desktop computers and/or handheld mobile devices).Non-electronic personal knowledge bases have probably existed in some form for centuries: Da Vinci's notebooks are a famous example. More commonly, files of index cards (in German, Zettelkasten), edge-notched cards and annotated private libraries, have served this function in the pre-electronic age. Undoubtedly the most famous early formulation of an electronic PKB was Vannevar Bush's description of the "memex" in 1945. In a 1962 technical report, human–computer interaction pioneer Douglas Engelbart (who would later become famous for his 1968 "Mother of All Demos" that demonstrated almost all the fundamental elements of modern personal computing) described his use of edge-notched cards to partially model Bush's memex.},

The use of intact soil cores closely mimics actual field conditions. However, the excavation of large intact soil cores is a time-consuming, labor-intensive process and may lead to soil compaction that would influence the solute transport behavior of the soil column. Repacked soil columns are used as an option to circumvent these challenges of intact soil cores. However, repacked soil columns also have their limitations and introduce other challenges. Here, we present a step by step procedure for the design of repacked soil columns to achieve a realistic bulk density, prevent preferential flow paths, and ensure hydraulic connectivity between soil layers.

	abstract = {In the present work, experimental design was used for the fast optimization of three kinds of sample digestion procedures with the ﬁnal aim of obtaining the COD value of wastewater samples. The digestion methods evaluated were “closed microwave-assisted” (CMWD), “open microwave-assisted” (OMWD) and “ultrasound-assisted” (USD). Classical digestion was used as reference method. The optimum values for the different variables studied in each method were: 90 psi pressure, 475 W power and 4 min irradiation time (CMWD); 150 ◦C temperature and 4 min irradiation time (OMWD); 90\% of maximum nominal power (180 W), 0.9 s (s−1) cycles and 1 min irradiation time (USD). In all cases, interference concentration that produces a deviation of 10\% in COD values is 13.4, 23.4, 21.1 and 2819 mg/L for S2−, Fe2+, NO2− and Cl−, respectively. Under optimum conditions, the proposed digestion methods have been successfully applied, with the exception of pyridine, to several pure organic compounds and COD recoveries for 10 real wastewater samples were ranged between 88 and 104\% of the values obtained with the classical (open reﬂux) method used as reference, with R.S.D. lower than 4\% in most cases. Thus, the use of ultrasound energy for COD determination seems to be an interesting and promising alternative to conventional open reﬂux and microwave-assisted digestion methods used for the same purpose since the instrumentation is simpler, cheaper and safer and the digestion step faster than the ones used for the same purpose.},

	abstract = {Inhibition by ammonium at concentrations above 1000 mgN/L is known to harm the methanogenesis phase of anaerobic digestion. We anaerobically digested swine waste and achieved steady state COD-removal efficiency of around 52\% with no fatty-acid or H 2 accumulation. As the anaerobic microbial community adapted to the gradual increase of total ammonia-N (NH 3 -N) from 890 ± 295 to 2040 ± 30 mg/L, the Bacterial and Archaeal communities became less diverse. Phylotypes most closely related to hydrogenotrophic Methanoculleus (36.4\%) and Methanobrevibacter (11.6\%), along with acetoclastic Methanosaeta (29.3\%), became the most abundant Archaeal sequences during acclimation. This was accompanied by a sharp increase in the relative abundances of phylotypes most closely related to acetogens and fatty-acid producers ( Clostridium , Coprococcus , and Sphaerochaeta ) and syntrophic fatty-acid Bacteria ( Syntrophomonas , Clostridium , Clostridiaceae species, and Cloacamonaceae species) that have metabolic capabilities for butyrate and propionate fermentation, as well as for reverse acetogenesis. Our results provide evidence countering a prevailing theory that acetoclastic methanogens are selectively inhibited when the total ammonia-N concentration is greater than {\textasciitilde}1000 mgN/L. Instead, acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens coexisted in the presence of total ammonia-N of {\textasciitilde}2000 mgN/L by establishing syntrophic relationships with fatty-acid fermenters, as well as homoacetogens able to carry out forward and reverse acetogenesis.},

Both undigested and digested samples were applied in parallel experiments for comparison regarding the requirements of hydraulic retention times (HRTs), removal efficiencies of nitrogen, phosphorus, and chemical oxygen demand (COD), biomass productivities, and CO2 sequestration abilities. It was demonstrated that algae grown in undigested dairy manure achieved removal rates of 99.7\%, 89.5\%, 92.0\%, and 75.5\% for NH4+–N, TN, TP, and COD, respectively, under a 5-day HRT, while the HRT had to extend to 20 days in order to achieve 100.0\% removal of NH4+–N in digested one with simultaneous removals of 93.6\% of TN, 89.2\% of TP, and 55.4\% of COD. The higher organic carbon contained in undigested dairy manure helped boost the growth of mixotrophic Chlorella, thus resulting in a much shorter HRT needed for complete removal of NH4+–N. Moreover, algae grown in digested dairy manure provided more penitential than those grown in undigested one in CO2 sequestration per milligram of harvested dried biomass (1.68 mg CO2/mg dry weight (DW) vs 0.99 mg CO2/mg DW), but did not surpass in total the amount of CO2 sequestered on a 15-day period basis because of the better productivity gained in undigested dairy manure.},

The study is comprised of five different fractions, having different quantities of C. vulgaris. From the batch reactor operations it was observed that increasing the content of C. vulgaris in the wastewater caused an apparent increase of removal rates in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), NH3-N and PO4-P. More quantitatively, increasing C. vulgaris content from 1 to 10 g/L caused an increase of removal rate of BOD from 80.41\% to 82.92\%; COD from 78.33\% to 82.30\%; TN from 81.04\% to 84.81\%; TP from 32.26\% to 36.12\%; NH3-N from 96.90\% to 97.26\%; and PO4-P from 44.76\% to 48.71\%. Moreover, run 4 fractions (6 g/L in wastewater) possessed a better removal rate than the other four fractions studied. The results also indicated that TN and NH3-N were more effectively removed than TP and PO4-P. The optimal ratio of C. vulgaris density and orthophosphate concentration caused an enhancement of removal efficiency.},

	abstract = {Background, aim, and scope Chemical oxygen demand (COD) is used as a discharge standard parameter in wastewater treatment plant design, environmental modelling and many other applications. Chloride interference is an important problem of COD measurement for wastewaters containing low organic matter and high chloride concentrations. In case of chloride concentrations up to 2,000 mg/L, mercury sulphate addition at a ratio of 10:1 (HgSO4:Cl−) can adequately mask the interference. When chloride concentration exceeds 2,000 mg/L, this ratio becomes ineffective to hinder the interference. At this point, it is proposed to use a greater and constant ratio of mercury sulphate addition. However, this application sometimes results in extra mercury sulphate addition which is not necessary. Even in some cases, greater addition of mercury sulphate alone is not a solution to erroneous measurement results. The purpose of the study is to determine optimum HgSO4:Cl− ratios according to the chloride concentrations of the samples and to show the importance of the strength of the digestion solution for the correct determination of the COD parameter.},

	abstract = {Requirements for successful biological treatment of acid mine drainage (AMD) rely on the reduction of sulphates by microorganisms using a suitable organic carbon source. Various carbon sources, such as domestic wastewater sludge, have previously been used in the semi-passive biological treatment of AMD. Domestic wastewater sludge is however highly variable in its composition, making laboratory experimentation difficult. Synthetic medium was therefore formulated based on the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the biological degradable organic matter (BOD) of domestic wastewater sludge. Four synthetic media compositions were formulated consisting of different ratios of meat extract, vegetable extract, sodium chloride, potassium phosphate, urea, ammonium chloride, iron sulphate, magnesium sulphate and glucose. The media composition with BOD and COD measurements closest to that of anaerobic domestic wastewater sludge was selected for further studies. The combination of AMD to synthetic wastewater sludge in 3 ratios was determined for COD and sulphate reduction in bioreactors over a period of 90 d. The highest reduction of 86.76\% in COD and 99.22\% in sulphate content were obtained in a 1:1 AMD: synthetic domestic wastewater sludge (SDWWS) ratio that calculated to a COD/sulphate ratio of 3.},

	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Solubility&oldid=1031815404},
	abstract = {Solubility is the property of a solid, liquid or gaseous chemical substance called solute to dissolve in a solid, liquid or gaseous solvent. The solubility of a substance fundamentally depends on the physical and chemical properties of the solute and solvent as well as on temperature, pressure and presence of other chemicals (including changes to the pH) of the solution. The extent of the solubility of a substance in a specific solvent is measured as the saturation concentration, where adding more solute does not increase the concentration of the solution and begins to precipitate the excess amount of solute.
Insolubility is the inability to dissolve in a solid, liquid or gaseous solvent.
Most often, the solvent is a liquid, which can be a pure substance or a mixture. One may also speak of solid solution, but rarely of solution in a gas (see vapor–liquid equilibrium instead).
Under certain conditions, the equilibrium solubility can be exceeded to give a so-called supersaturated solution, which is metastable. Metastability of crystals can also lead to apparent differences in the amount of a chemical that dissolves depending on its crystalline form or particle size. A supersaturated solution generally crystallises when 'seed' crystals are introduced and rapid equilibration occurs. Phenylsalicylate is one such simple observable substance when fully melted and then cooled below its fusion point.
Solubility is not to be confused with the ability to dissolve a substance, because the solution might also occur because of a chemical reaction. For example, zinc dissolves (with effervescence) in hydrochloric acid as a result of a chemical reaction releasing hydrogen gas in a displacement reaction. The zinc ions are soluble in the acid.
The solubility of a substance is an entirely different property from the rate of solution, which is how fast it dissolves. The smaller a particle is, the faster it dissolves although there are many factors to add to this generalization.
Crucially, solubility applies to all areas of chemistry, geochemistry, inorganic, physical, organic and biochemistry. In all cases it will depend on the physical conditions (temperature, pressure and concentration) and the enthalpy and entropy directly relating to the solvents and solutes concerned. By far the most common solvent in chemistry is water which is a solvent for most ionic compounds as well as a wide range of organic substances. This is a crucial factor in acidity and alkalinity and much environmental and geochemical work.},

Solutions with high suspended concentration of solids, as well as digestates from an anaerobic reactor, were used during the comparative test. For solid substrates, the COD recovery was about 100\% when the proposed method was used. For solutions with solid content higher than 20 g TS L−1, the recovery was only completed when the proposed method was used, showing that the methods traditionally employed are not very appropriate for samples with the described characteristics. For instance, percentages of COD recovery in the ranges of 77.3–87.1\% and 89.4–94.1\% were achieved when the SM-OR and SM-CR methods were used, respectively. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Horizontal subsurface ﬂow constructed wetlands (CWs) planted with Phragmites australis were set up to analyze the effect of external ferrous iron (Fe2þ) addition on chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrogen removal. The results showed that external Fe2þ addition has no signiﬁcant effect on COD removal, while the COD removal efﬁciencies in CWs with Fe2þ addition were slightly lower than those in CWs without Fe2þ addition, since Fe2þ as an electron donor for denitriﬁcation may decrease the consumption of organic carbon. However, external Fe2þ addition signiﬁcantly enhanced the nitrogen removal capability of the CWs. With an increase in external Fe2þ concentration, the removal efﬁciencies for total nitrogen (TN), nitrate nitrogen (NO3eN), and ammonium nitrogen (NH4eN) all increased. The removal efﬁciencies for TN and NH4eN were greatest for an inﬂuent Fe2þ concentration of 50 mg LÀ1, while the greatest removal efﬁciencies for NO3eN were observed at an inﬂuent Fe2þ concentration of 150 mg LÀ1. With increasing hydraulic retention time (HRT), the COD and NO3eN removal efﬁciencies in the CWs with external Fe2þ addition increase sharply and then became stable, while the removal efﬁciency for TN exhibited a continuous increase. The removal efﬁciency for NH4eN was greatest at an HRT of 5 de7 d with Fe2þ addition. The change in pH with increasing HRT indicated that external Fe2þ addition did not signiﬁcantly affect the pH value of the efﬂuent water, but that the wetland systems caused an increase in efﬂuent pH. Fe2þ addition remarkably reduced the oxygen-reduction potential of both the inﬂuent and efﬂuent water, which was beneﬁcial to denitriﬁcation of microorganisms.},

	abstract = {We investigated the feasibility of bioremediation as a treatment option for a chronically diesel-oil-polluted soil in an alpine glacier area at an altitude of 2,875 m above sea level. To examine the efficiencies of natural attenuation and biostimulation, we used field-incubated lysimeters (mesocosms) with unfertilized and fertilized (N-P-K) soil. For three summer seasons (July 1997 to September 1999), we monitored changes in hydrocarbon concentrations in soil and soil leachate and the accompanying changes in soil microbial counts and activity. A significant reduction in the diesel oil level could be achieved. At the end of the third summer season (after 780 days), the initial level of contamination (2,612 ± 70 μg of hydrocarbons g [dry weight] of soil−1) was reduced by (50 ± 4)\% and (70 ± 2)\% in the unfertilized and fertilized soil, respectively. Nonetheless, the residual levels of contamination (1,296 ± 110 and 774 ± 52 μg of hydrocarbons g [dry weight] of soil−1 in the unfertilized and fertilized soil, respectively) were still high. Most of the hydrocarbon loss occurred during the first summer season ([42 ± 6]\% loss) in the fertilized soil and during the second summer season ([41 ± 4]\% loss) in the unfertilized soil. In the fertilized soil, all biological parameters (microbial numbers, soil respiration, catalase and lipase activities) were significantly enhanced and correlated significantly with each other, as well as with the residual hydrocarbon concentration, pointing to the importance of biodegradation. The effect of biostimulation of the indigenous soil microorganisms declined with time. The microbial activities in the unfertilized soil fluctuated around background levels during the whole study.},

The study was conducted with 14 sampling periods in three shrimp ponds in An Bien district, Kien Giang province, where shrimp were stocked at density of 1-3 inds/m2. The average pond area was 1.5-1.7 ha with a depth of 1.2 m. Water was exchanged once a month. A certain number of shrimps was suplemented in the ponds once a month, and no feed provided during the culture period. Thirty shrimps were collected each time for analysis of feed composition in their digestive tract. Water parameters including temperature, pH, salinity, TSS, TN and TP were also recorded. The results showed that the water parameters are suitable for the development of natural food and growth of shrimp in ponds. Variation of natural food depended on nutrient content and salinity in the water environment. Besides detritus with high proportion, the study identified a total of 10 natural food groups in the digestive tract (DT) of shrimp. The composition and quantity of natural food of shrimp were recorded from 8-23 genera and 6-6,289 individuals/DT, respectively. Shrimp with an average length of 1.5±0.4cm to 3.6±0.6cm utilized mainly Bacillariophyta, Rotifera, Copepoda, Polychaeta and detritus. Adult shrimps with a size of 12.3±0.7cm consumed a lot of detritus and Polychaeta. In general, as shrimps grow up from 4.8±0.5 cm to 5.3±0.8 cm, their feeding spectrum changes from planktonic to benthic organisms.},

The phylogeny of the isolates was investigated using 16S rDNA and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region from 16S to 23S rDNA. The phylogenetic tree of the 16S rDNA showed that ten of the eleven isolates belonged to Bradyrhizobium elkanii, and one belonged to Bradyrhizobium japonicum. The topology of the ITS tree was similar to that of 16S rDNA. The acetylene reduction activity was higher for the nodules inoculated with the isolated B. elkanii strains than for those inoculated with B. japonicum strains. When C. ternatea plants were inoculated with various Bradyrhizobium USDA strains isolated from Glycine max, C. ternatea formed many effective nodules with B. elkanii, especially USDA61. However, acetylene reduction activity per plant and the growth were higher in C. ternatea inoculated with our isolates. From these data we propose that effective rhizobia inoculant were identified for C. ternatea cultivation.},

	abstract = {The present study was conducted to isolate and characterize rhizobial strains from root nodules of cultivated legumes, i.e. chickpea, mungbean, pea and siratro. Preliminary characterization of these isolates was done on the basis of plant infectivity test, acetylene reduction assay, C-source utilization, phosphate solubilization, phytohormones and polysaccharide production. The plant infectivity test and acetylene reduction assay showed effective root nodule formation by all the isolates on their respective hosts, except for chickpea isolate Ca-18 that failed to infect its original host. All strains showed homology to a typical Rhizobium strain on the basis of growth pattern, C-source utilization and polysaccharide production. The strain Ca-18 was characterized by its phosphate solubilization and indole acetic acid (IAA) production. The genetic relationship of the six rhizobial strains was carried out by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) including a reference strain of Bradyrhizobium japonicum TAL-102. Analysis conducted with 60 primers discriminated between the strains of Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium in two different clusters. One of the primers, OPB-5, yielded a unique RAPD pattern for the six strains and well discriminated the non-nodulating chickpea isolate Ca-18 from all the other nodulating rhizobial strains. Isolate Ca-18 showed the least homology of 15\% and 18\% with Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium, respectively, and was probably not a (Brady)rhizobium strain. Partial 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis for MN-S, TAL-102 and Ca-18 strains showed 97\% homology between MN-S and TAL-102 strains, supporting the view that they were strains of B. japonicum species. The non-infective isolate Ca-18 was 67\% different from the other two strains and probably was an Agrobacterium strain.},

	abstract = {In many legumes, the colonization of roots by rhizobia is via “root hair entry” and its molecular mechanisms have been extensively studied. However, the nodulation of peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.) by Bradyrhizobium strains requires an intercellular colonization process called “crack entry,” which is understudied. To understand the intercellular crack entry process, it is critical to develop the tools and resources related to the rhizobium in addition to focus on investigating the mechanisms of the plant host. In this study, we isolated a Bradyrhizobium sp. strain, Lb8 from peanut root nodules and sequenced it using PacBio long reads. The complete genome sequence was a circular chromosome of 8,718,147 base-pair (bp) with an average GC content of 63.14\%. No plasmid sequence was detected in the sequenced DNA sample. A total of 8,433 potential protein-encoding genes, one rRNA cluster, and 51 tRNA genes were annotated. Fifty-eight percent of the predicted genes showed similarity to genes of known functions and were classiﬁed into 27 subsystems representing various biological processes. The genome shared 92\% of the gene families with B. diazoefﬁcens USDA 110T. A presumptive symbiosis island of 778 Kb was detected, which included two clusters of nif and nod genes. A total of 711 putative protein-encoding genes were in this region, among which 455 genes have potential functions related to symbiotic nitrogen ﬁxation and DNA transmission. Of 21 genes annotated as transposase, 16 were located in the symbiosis island. Lb8 possessed both Type III and Type IV protein secretion systems, and our work elucidated the association of ﬂagellar Type III secretion systems in bradyrhizobia. These observations suggested that complex rearrangement, such as horizontal transfer and insertion of different DNA elements, might be responsible for the plasticity of the Bradyrhizobium genome.},

	abstract = {Legume species belonging to the genus Lespedeza are annual or perennial herb or shrub plants that grow in the northern hemisphere. They are known for the formation of root nodules, but little information is available about their microsymbionts. In this study, 58 root-nodule isolates from Lespedeza spp., obtained from China and the USA, were characterized using numerical taxonomic analysis of phenotypic features, SDS-PAGE analysis of whole-cell proteins, DNA–DNA hybridization, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and crossnodulation with selected legume species. From the results generated using these approaches, it was concluded that Lespedeza spp. were promiscuous hosts for rhizobia. Four main clusters of bacteria, which included 35 of the strains isolated from Lespedeza spp., were deﬁned upon numerical taxonomic analysis ; these groups corresponded to those determined from analyses of protein electrophoretic and DNA–DNA hybridization data. The four clusters were found to deﬁne strains belonging to one of four species, Sinorhizobium saheli, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Bradyrhizobium elkanii or a novel species of the genus Bradyrhizobium. The strains of B. japonicum and B. elkanii were all from the USA soil samples, and their representative strains could not nodulate soybean. The seven strains found to represent the novel Bradyrhizobium sp. were from China. These were differentiated from recognized species of the genus Bradyrhizobium by all of the taxonomic methods used here ; hence, it is proposed that the novel strains isolated from Lespedeza spp. represent a novel species of the genus Bradyrhizobium, Bradyrhizobium yuanmingense. The type strain of the novel species, CCBAU 10071T (l CFNEB 101T), formed ineffective nodules on Medicago sativa and Melilotus albus but did not nodulate soybean. The other 23 bacterial strains isolated from Lespedeza spp. were found to form single branches or small groups (two to three strains) that were related to Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium and Sinorhizobium spp. on the basis of numerical taxonomic analysis, indicating the possibility that other rhizobial species are also associated with Lespedeza spp.},

              Rhizobium
              sp. strain NGR234 is a unique alphaproteobacterium (order
              Rhizobiales
              ) that forms nitrogen-fixing nodules with more legumes than any other microsymbiont. We report here that the 3.93-Mbp chromosome (cNGR234) encodes most functions required for cellular growth. Few essential functions are encoded on the 2.43-Mbp megaplasmid (pNGR234
              b
              ), and none are present on the second 0.54-Mbp symbiotic plasmid (pNGR234
              a
              ). Among many striking features, the 6.9-Mbp genome encodes more different secretion systems than any other known rhizobia and probably most known bacteria. Altogether, 132 genes and proteins are linked to secretory processes. Secretion systems identified include general and export pathways, a twin arginine translocase secretion system, six type I transporter genes, one functional and one putative type III system, three type IV attachment systems, and two putative type IV conjugation pili. Type V and VI transporters were not identified, however. NGR234 also carries genes and regulatory networks linked to the metabolism of a wide range of aromatic and nonaromatic compounds. In this way, NGR234 can quickly adapt to changing environmental stimuli in soils, rhizospheres, and plants. Finally, NGR234 carries at least six loci linked to the quenching of quorum-sensing signals, as well as one gene (
              ngrI
              ) that possibly encodes a novel type of autoinducer I molecule.},

	abstract = {During characterization of rhizobacteria, strain ­DBTS2T was isolated from the rhizosphere soil samples of healthy tomato plants and characterized using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequences showed this strain belonged to the genus Rhizobium and was most closely related to Rhizobium subbaraonis ­JC85T (99.1\%) and Rhizobium daejeonense CCBAU 1­ 0050T (97\%). Cells of strain D­ BTS2T were Gram-negative, short rod, aerobic and non-motile. This novel strain was found to grow at 20–45 °C (optimum 25–37 °C), pH 5–9 (optimum 8) and in the presence of 4\% NaCl. It was positive for catalase and oxidase. The predominant cellular fatty acids were Summed Feature 8 (52.7\%) and ­C19:0 cyclo ω8c (23.3\%). The polar lipids of strain D­ BTS2T consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, unidentified aminophospholipid, unidentified aminolipid, four unidentified phospholipids, unidentified lipid, phosphatidylcholine, unknown glycolipid and unknown aminophosphoglycolipids. Q-10 was the major quinone. The DNA–DNA hybridization similarity values between the strain ­DBTS2T and R. subbaraonis ­JC85T, R. daejeonense CCBAU ­10050T and Rhizobium azooxidifex ­DSM100211T were 46.4\%, 20.7\% and 25.5\%, respectively. The ANI value was 91.96\% between strain D­ BTS2T and R. subbaraonis ­JC85T and 75.18\% between strain D­ BTS2T and R. daejeonense CCBAU ­10050T. The DNA G+C content of the genomic DNA was 63.1 mol\%. Based on these results, it was concluded that the isolate represents a novel species of the genus Rhizobium, for which the name Rhizobium rhizolycopersici sp. nov. is proposed, with ­DBTS2T (= CICC ­24887T = ACCC61707 = JCM 34245) as the type strain.},

In this work, we immobilized Bradyrhizobium sp. SEMIA6144 or Azospirillum brasilense Az39 cells in 2\% alginate beads prepared by ionic gelation process, and then stored up to 12 months at 4 °C. Alginate matrix showed interaction with the immobilized bacteria (FTIR), allowed a constant release of cells, and improved their viability and capability to interact with Arachis hypogaea. Cell number into beads reached 107 CFU.bead−1; however, viability decreased from 4 months of storage for Az39, while it was maintained up to 12 months for SEMIA6144, showing a low metabolic activity measured by the MTT assay. Adhesion of SEMIA6144 and Az39 from new beads to peanut root was 11.5\% and 16\%, respectively, higher than non-immobilized bacteria. Peanut inoculation with 12 months storage SEMIA6144 beads significantly increased root length and biomass at 30 days of growth, and under restrictive water condition (RWC), nodulation and total plant N content increased compared with liquid inoculation. Our results demonstrate that immobilization of SEMIA6144 and Az39 in alginate matrix is a potential alternative to enhance peanut growth even under RWC.},

            WikiPathways (https://www.wikipathways.org) is a biological pathway database known for its collaborative nature and open science approaches. With the core idea of the scientific community developing and curating biological knowledge in pathway models, WikiPathways lowers all barriers for accessing and using its content. Increasingly more content creators, initiatives, projects and tools have started using WikiPathways. Central in this growth and increased use of WikiPathways are the various communities that focus on particular subsets of molecular pathways such as for rare diseases and lipid metabolism. Knowledge from published pathway figures helps prioritize pathway development, using optical character and named entity recognition. We show the growth of WikiPathways over the last three years, highlight the new communities and collaborations of pathway authors and curators, and describe various technologies to connect to external resources and initiatives. The road toward a sustainable, community-driven pathway database goes through integration with other resources such as Wikidata and allowing more use, curation and redistribution of WikiPathways content.},

	abstract = {The terms “reproducibility crisis” and “replicationcrisis” gained currency in conversation and in print over thelast decade (e.g., Pashler \& Wagenmakers 2012), as disappointingresults emerged from large scale reproducibility projects in variousmedical, life and behavioural sciences (e.g., Open ScienceCollaboration, OSC 2015). In 2016, a poll conducted by the journalNature reported that more than half (52\%) of scientistssurveyed believed science was facing a “replicationcrisis” (Baker 2016). More recently, some authors have moved tomore positive terms for describing this episode in science; forexample, Vazire (2018) refers instead to a “credibilityrevolution” highlighting the improved methods and open sciencepractices it has motivated., The crisis often refers collectively to at least the following things:, The associated open science reform movement aims to rectify conditionsthat led to the crisis. This is done by promoting activities such asdata sharing and public pre-registration of studies, and by advocatingstricter editorial policies around statistical reporting includingpublishing replication studies and statistically non-significantresults., This review consists of four distinct parts. First, we look at theterm “reproducibility” and related terms like“repeatability” and “replication”, presentingsome definitions and conceptual discussion about the epistemicfunction of different types of replication studies. Second, wedescribe the meta-science research that has established andcharacterised the reproducibility crisis, including large scalereplication projects and surveys of questionable research practices invarious scientific communities. Third, we look at attempts to addressepistemological questions about the limitations of replication, andwhat value it holds for scientific inquiry and the accumulation ofknowledge. The fourth and final part describes some of the manyinitiatives the open science reform movement has proposed (and in manycases implemented) to improve reproducibility in science. In addition,we reflect there on the values and norms which those reforms embody,noting their relevance to the debate about the role of values in thephilosophy of science.},

	abstract = {Crafting a good title is like bending a straight line into a seamless connected circle. Let me explain. Titles are the first thing readers see, yet they are often the final part of writing a manuscript, and just as often given the least attention. Guides on writing scientific papers recommend starting with the Methods section, followed by Results, Discussion, Introduction, Abstract, and Title. There is a certain degree of logic to this linear order, since authors already have detailed notes and documentation on the methods used, the results obtained, and the interpretation of the results when they begin to write a paper. The title, however, is the component that closes the circle. The title draws from the other sections of the paper and becomes the face of the paper—the descriptor, the advertisement, the pitch. Like a billboard, it is your 10-second opportunity to connect with the passerby (the reader). So it is important to make the title count. Here I provide some tips and examples to help you reach this goal.},

The board of directors is meeting at the New York Hilton, and you are waiting to ride the elevator from the 31st floor to the lobby. The doors open, and you suddenly find yourself standing with Bill Gates, whose philanthropic Gates’ Foundation is meeting at the same hotel. Gates notices the logo on your shirt of a small child reading a book by the light of a lantern and asks you, “What is that? What do you do?”Indeed, what do you do now? You have 30 floors, or about 1 minute, to get your message across. So you explain that normal living activities cease in many countries in the world after the sun goes down. Children have no light to read textbooks, mothers no light to cook, fathers no light to earn income. With this background, you then explain that the Light Is The Solution Foundation has addressed this problem by developing rechargeable lanterns that are low-cost, have a battery life of 30 hours, and put out light equivalent to three 60-W bulbs. You have given away 4500 lanterns in one country and have results showing that more children now share books, study together, and graduate at a higher rate. In fact, average incomes have risen by 20\% for families who have received a lantern. You have concluded that this unique program could be expanded to any country that has even the crudest electrical grid or generators for recharging the lanterns.},

	abstract = {Tannins (or tannoids) are a class of astringent, polyphenolic biomolecules that bind to and precipitate proteins and various other organic compounds including amino acids and alkaloids.
The term tannin (from Anglo-Norman tanner, from Medieval Latin tannāre, from tannum, oak bark) refers to the use of oak and other bark in tanning animal hides into leather. By extension, the term tannin is widely applied to any large polyphenolic compound containing sufficient hydroxyls and other suitable groups (such as carboxyls) to form strong complexes with various macromolecules.
The tannin compounds are widely distributed in many species of plants, where they play a role in protection from predation (including as pesticides) and might help in regulating plant growth. The astringency from the tannins is what causes the dry and puckery feeling in the mouth following the consumption of unripened fruit, red wine or tea. Likewise, the destruction or modification of tannins with time plays an important role when determining harvesting times.
Tannins have molecular weights ranging from 500 to over 3,000 (gallic acid esters) and up to 20,000 Daltons (proanthocyanidins).},

	abstract = {Background:
Streptomyces avermitilis, belonging to Actinomycetes, is specialized for production of avermectin, used as an anthelmintic and insecticidal agent. It is mostly found in soil and its isolation is very crucial for medically important avermectin production.

Objectives:
In the present study, 10 bacterial isolates lacking antimicrobial activities were isolated from the soil samples collected from different areas of Lahore, Pakistan.

Materials and Methods:
Three distinctive localities of Lahore were opted for soil assortment to isolate S. avermitilis. About 50 isolates of Streptomyces species were attained through selective prescreening procedures. All of these isolates were studied for production of the secondary metabolite, avermectin. Different test like soluble pigment color and melanin formation were used for identification. Biochemical characterizations of those isolates closely resembling the control in morphological characteristics, soluble pigment color and melanin formation tests were performed.

Results:
The 10 selected isolates were identified as the avermectin-producing strain by fermentation and characterized on ISP2 medium for aerial and reverse side mycelia color, soluble pigment color and melanin formation, in comparison with S. avermitilis DSM 41445. The best avermectin-producing isolate S1-C (10.15 mg/L) showed similar result as S. avermitilis DSM 41445, when subjected for culture characteristics analysis in different media along with biochemical characterization.

Conclusions:
From the results, it was concluded that agricultural lands around Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (PCSIR) Campus Lahore were rich sources of industrially important Streptomyces, especially S. avermitilis.},

The aim of this work was to screen isolated actinobacterial strains to explore their ability to produce extracellular enzymes that participate in the degradation of polysaccharides and their ability to cometabolically transform phenolic compounds of various complexities. Actinobacterial strains were isolated from meadow and forest soils and screened for their ability to grow on lignocellulose. The potential to transform 14C-labelled phenolic substrates (dehydrogenation polymer (DHP), lignin and catechol) and to produce a range of extracellular, hydrolytic enzymes was investigated in three strains of Streptomyces spp. that possessed high lignocellulose degrading activity. Isolated strains showed high variation in their ability to produce cellulose- and hemicellulose-degrading enzymes and were able to mineralise up to 1.1\% and to solubilise up to 4\% of poplar lignin and to mineralise up to 11.4\% and to solubilise up to 64\% of catechol, while only minimal mineralisation of DHP was observed. The results confirm the potential importance of Actinobacteria in lignocellulose degradation, although it is likely that the decomposition of biopolymers is limited to strains that represent only a minor portion of the entire community, while the range of simple, carbon-containing compounds that serve as sources for actinobacterial growth is relatively wide.},

This paper aims to evaluate the tannin extraction potential of the green coconut mesocarp, as well as its adhesive capacity. Tannin extraction was performed with sodium sulfite diluted in water at 0\%, 1\%, 5\% and 8\% concentrations. It was observed which extraction resulted in better yield and characteristics to be used as an adhesive agent. The concentration of sodium sulfite at 5\% allowed higher yields of tannin extraction. When compared to phenol formaldehyde, the tannin had similar adhesive characteristics such as 153.84 cp viscosity and 54.57\% solid content. For the FT-IR spectroscopy analysis, dry samples of the coconut mesocarp were used. The peaks observed in the infrared spectrum of the green coconut mesocarp are characteristic of tannins found in biomass, presenting desirable chemical characteristics to be used as an adhesive agent. The coconut mesocarp is a material with potential for tannin extraction, making it suitable to be used in the gluing of panels.},

	abstract = {The bark of Acacia mearnsii De Wild. (black wattle) contains signiﬁcant amounts of water-soluble components acalled “wattle tannin”. Following the discovery of its strong antioxidant activity, a wattle tannin dietary supplement has been developed and as part of developing new dietary supplements, a literature search was conducted using the SciFinder data base for “Acacia species and their biological activities”. An analysis of the references found indicated that the name of Acacia nilotica had been changed to Vachellia nilotica, even though the name of the genus Acacia originated from its original name. This review brieﬂy describes why and how the name of A. nilotica changed. Tannin has been analyzed using the Stiasny method when the tannin is used to make adhesives and the hide-powder method is used when the tannin is to be used for leather tanning. A simple UV method is also able to be used to estimate the values for both adhesives and leather tanning applications. The tannin content in bark can also be estimated using NIR and NMR. Tannin content estimations using pyrolysis/GC, electrospray mass spectrometry and quantitative 31P-NMR analyses have also been described. Tannins consists mostly of polyﬂavanoids and all the compounds isolated have been updated. Antioxidant activities of the tannin relating to anti-tumor properties, the viability of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and also anti-hypertensive effects have been studied. The antioxidant activity of proanthocyanidins was found to be higher than that of ﬂavan-3-ol monomers. A total of fourteen papers and two patents reported the antimicrobial activities of wattle tannin. Bacteria were more susceptible to the tannins than the fungal strains tested. Several bacteria were inhibited by the extract from A. mearnsii bark. The growth inhibition mechanisms of E. coli were investigated. An interaction between extracts from A. mearnsii bark and antibiotics has also been studied. The extracts from A. mearnsii bark inhibit the growth of cyanobacteria. Wattle tannin has the ability to inactivate α-amylase, lipase and glucosidase. In vivo experiments on anti-obesity and anti-diabetes were also reported. Several patents relating to these enzymes for anti-diabetes and anti-obesity are in the literature. In addition, studies on Acacia bark extract regarding its antitermite activities, inhibition of itching in atopic dermatitis and anti-inﬂammatory effects have also been reported. The growth of bacteria was inhibited by the extract from A. mearnsii bark, and typical intestinal bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris and S. marcescenes was also inhibited in vitro by extracts. Based on these results, the Acacia bark extract may inhibit not only the growth of these typical intestinal bacteria but also the growth of other types of intestinal bacteria such as Clostridium and Bacteroides, a so-called “bad bacteria”. If the tannin extract from A. mearnsii bark inhibits growth of these “bad bacteria” in vivo evaluation, the extracts might be usable as a new dietary supplement, which could control the human intestinal microbiome to keep the body healthy.},

	abstract = {The search for new tannases with novel enzymatic properties suitable for industrial applications has been a continuous effort since the first discovery of the enzyme more than a century ago. A tannase gene (Ss-Tan) from the Grampositive bacterium Streptomyces sviceus was identified, chemically synthesized, and cloned into a C-terminal His-tagged vector for expression in Escherichia coli. The tannase possesses the active site motif of GXSXG that is conserved for serine hydrolases. The residues that constitute the catalytic triad and galloyl binding site in bacterial tannases are found conserved in Ss-Tan, which include Ser209, Asp452, His484 and Lys370, Glu384, Asp454, respectively. Ss-Tan was overexpressed in E. coli BL21-AI cells with high productivity. Enzymatic assay revealed that the enzyme displays tannase activities to hydrolyze both the ester bonds and depside bonds in hydrolyzable tannins. Kinetic analysis indicated that the enzyme preferentially acts on depside bonds with considerably higher substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency. The enzyme showed maximum activity around pH 8.0 and at 50 °C with the highest melting temperature close to 70 °C. The high depsidase activity and thermostablility of Ss-Tan may make the enzyme suitable for potential industrial applications to achieve complete digestion of hydrolyzable tannins.},

Effective groups serve both as a guide to inoculant preparation and as a basis for predicting the need for inoculation. This review included all aspects of rhizobial work, starting from isolation and characterization of root nodule bacteria from the field to authentication of the symbiotic effectiveness test under sterile sand condition. This review shows the process on how to evaluate the symbiotic effectiveness along with growth responses to varied conditions of pH, temperature, antibiotics as well as carbon and nitrogen sources. Goal of Rhizobium scientists is to discover new and better strains for use in legume inoculants. This pursuit entails the collection of isolates, strain characterization, assessment of symbiotic capacity and comparison to strains currently included within inoculants. During the process of collection, care should be taken not to simply collect strains that were obtained through past inoculation, and the elite strains identified through exploration and characterization should be distinguished as original through strain identification procedures. This was a very valuable review for researchers dealing with improving soil fertility and supporting sustainable crop production with the minimum use of costly and environmentally unfavorable chemical fertilizers.},

Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) further showed a considerable level of genetic diversity among the Bradyrhizobial isolates. PCR-RFLP of 16S rDNA supported existence of two divergent groups among indigenous Bradyrhizobial isolates, at similarity level of 66, and 75 and 74\% of similarity within the group.

Today we must use every avenue from science and technology available to address these challenges. The natural process of symbiotic nitrogen fixation, whereby plants such as legumes fix atmospheric nitrogen gas to ammonia, usable by plants can have a substantial impact as it is found in nature, has low environmental and economic costs and is broadly established.

	abstract = {Background: Bacterial nitrogen fixation is the biological process by which atmospheric nitrogen is uptaken by bacteroids located in plant root nodules and converted into ammonium through the enzymatic activity of nitrogenase. In practice, this biological process serves as a natural form of fertilization and its optimization has significant implications in sustainable agricultural programs. Currently, the advent of high-throughput technology supplies with valuable data that contribute to understanding the metabolic activity during bacterial nitrogen fixation. This undertaking is not trivial, and the development of computational methods useful in accomplishing an integrative, descriptive and predictive framework is a crucial issue to decoding the principles that regulated the metabolic activity of this biological process.
Results: In this work we present a systems biology description of the metabolic activity in bacterial nitrogen fixation. This was accomplished by an integrative analysis involving high-throughput data and constraint-based modeling to characterize the metabolic activity in Rhizobium etli bacteroids located at the root nodules of Phaseolus vulgaris (bean plant). Proteome and transcriptome technologies led us to identify 415 proteins and 689 up-regulated genes that orchestrate this biological process. Taking into account these data, we: 1) extended the metabolic reconstruction reported for R. etli; 2) simulated the metabolic activity during symbiotic nitrogen fixation; and 3) evaluated the in silico results in terms of bacteria phenotype. Notably, constraint-based modeling simulated nitrogen fixation activity in such a way that 76.83\% of the enzymes and 69.48\% of the genes were experimentally justified. Finally, to further assess the predictive scope of the computational model, gene deletion analysis was carried out on nine metabolic enzymes. Our model concluded that an altered metabolic activity on these enzymes induced different effects in nitrogen fixation, all of these in qualitative agreement with observations made in R. etli and other Rhizobiaceas.
Conclusions: In this work we present a genome scale study of the metabolic activity in bacterial nitrogen fixation. This approach leads us to construct a computational model that serves as a guide for 1) integrating highthroughput data, 2) describing and predicting metabolic activity, and 3) designing experiments to explore the genotype-phenotype relationship in bacterial nitrogen fixation.},

	abstract = {Rhizobiaceae is a family of Rhizobiales order into Alphaproteobacteria class that presents genera associated with soil and planta hosts. Rhizobium is the type genus and encompasses the largest number of species into the family. Taxonomy is mostly supported by phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA sequences and nomenclature in Rhizobiaceae is one issue that has caused much discussion. Bacteria are phenotypically heterogeneous, predominately aerobic, and Gram-negative rod-shaped. Many species present large plasmids which harbor a large proportion of genome generally including genes involved in interaction with specific hosts. Some members of the Rhizobiaceae family are characterized by their ability to establish symbiotic associations with host plants and develop the process of biological nitrogen fixation. In contrast, others are able to establish pathogenicity against plants. Both skills can be exploited for applied purposes. The selection of efficient strains from Rhizobium and Ensifer designed to plant inoculants is one of important research viewing the production of microbial inoculants to help plant development. Considering Agrobacterium tumesfaciens, the management of its natural ability to transform plants is directed to obtaining disarmed strains and clone vectors widely applied to recombinant DNA technology and plant biotechnology. Finally, some genera in Rhizobiaceae family have intriguing metabolisms which allow degradation of potentially toxic molecules and thus could be applied as biomarkers or in bioremediation.},

	abstract = {Rapid detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) is a critical step in controlling tuberculosis (TB). In this study, we used IS6110 as the specific identification target to develop a novel hybridization signal amplification method (HSAM) for the rapid and direct detection of MTBC from clinical sputum specimens. This system consists of magnetic bead-linked capture probes for target isolation, dextran-based nanoparticles for amplifying the reporter molecule (biotinylated-FITC), and detection probes (2B-DNA) for binding the nanoparticles. Both the capture and detection probes were specific to the IS6110 target sequence. Our results determined that as few as 10 copies of the IS6110 sequence or 10 M. tuberculosis bacteria could be detected, indicating that the HSAM assay is as sensitive as conventional PCR, and the assay was specific enough to distinguish MTBC from nontuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM). A total of 176 clinical sputum specimens were collected for HSAM evaluation, and the results were compared to those from traditional culture and biochemical identification techniques. This assay had a sensitivity of 88.3\%, a specificity of 91.8\%, a positive predictive value of 93.8\% and a negative predictive value of 84.8\% for the detection of MTBC. This technique is highly sensitive and specific, is easy to perform, and does not require any sophisticated detection equipment; thus, this approach has great potential in clinical TB detection and diagnostic applications.},

Twenty-two TKD athletes performed a 2-hr TKD training session. After training, participants ingested green tea (T, caffeine 6 mg/kg and catechins 22 mg/kg) or an equal volume of water (W). Saliva samples were collected at three time points: before training (BT-T; BT-W), immediately after training (AT-T; AT-W), and 30 min after drinking green tea or water (Rec-T; Rec-W). Salivary total protein, immunoglobulin A (SIgA), lactoferrin, α-amylase activity, free radical scavenger activity (FRSA) and antibacterial capacity were measured. Salivary total protein, lactoferrin, SIgA concentrations and α-amylase activity increased significantly immediately after intensive TKD training. After tea drinking and 30 min rest, α-amylase activity and the ratio of α-amylase to total protein were significantly higher than before and after training. In addition, salivary antibacterial capacity was not affected by intense training, but green tea consumption after training enhanced salivary antibacterial capacity. Additionally, we observed that salivary FRSA was markedly suppressed immediately after training and quickly returned to pre-exercise values, regardless of which fluid was consumed. Our results show that green tea consumption significantly enhances the activity of α-amylase and salivary antibacterial capacity.},

	abstract = {Background
The incidence of resistance to the existing antibiotics by microorganisms demand increased effort in the development of new antibiotics for the treatment of microbial infections and diseases. Infections due to multidrug resistant pathogens are difficult to manage due to relatively limited choices of antimicrobial agents. This study investigated antimicrobial activities of the husk extract of Cocos nucifera on some bacteria that are associated with human diseases.

Methods
Powdered husk of Cocos nucifera was cold extracted using mixture of methanol and distilled water in ration 3:2 (v/v). Extract was partitioned into n-hexane. Chloroform, ethylacetate and n-butanol fractions and thereafter, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the extract and those of the fractions were determined. The ethylacetate fraction was found to be more active and was partially purified by a combination of thin-layer and column chromatography. Finally, the rate of killing, leakages of proteins, potassium ions and nucleotides from the tests bacterial cells were determined.

Results
The minimum Inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the extract ranged between 0.39 and 12.50 mg/ml and those of the fractions ranged between 0.16 and 5.00 mg/ml. The time-kill assay revealed a minimum of 27.8\% killed at 1 × MIC after 15 min contact time with the fractions and a minimum of 95\% killed after 120 min., Varying amount of proteins, potassium ions as well as nucleotides were leaked from selected bacterial isolates by the four active fractions. The amount of proteins leaked from the cells after 15 min contact time ranged between 3.56 and 19.08 μg/ml at 1 × MIC and between 10.97 and 19.54 μg/ml at 2 × MIC. The amount of potassium ions leaked from the cells after 15 min contact time ranged between 0.182 and 0.379 mg/ml at 1 × MIC and between 0.227 and 0.561 mg/ml at 2 × MIC. The nucleotides leaked from the cells after 15 min contact time ranged between 0.609 and 2.446 μg/ml at 1 × MIC and between 0.897 and 2.841 μg/ml at 2 × MIC.

Conclusions
This study established the possibility of developing antimicrobial agents of natural origin to combat resistance to antimicrobial compounds by some pathogens currently being experienced in agricultural and health care environments.},

Since ostrich meat is difficult to be differentiated macroscopically from beef, therefore new analytical methods are needed. To enforce labeling regulations for the authentication of ostrich meat, it might be of importance to develop and evaluate a rapid and reliable assay. In the present study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay based on the cytochrome b gene of the mitochondrial DNA of the species Struthio camelus was developed. The LAMP assay was used in combination with a real-time fluorometer. The developed system allowed the detection of 0.01\% ostrich meat products. In parallel, a direct swab method without nucleic acid extraction using the HYPLEX LPTV buffer was also evaluated. This rapid processing method allowed detection of ostrich meat without major incubation steps. In summary, the LAMP assay had excellent sensitivity and specificity for detecting ostrich meat and could provide a sampling-to-result identification-time of 15 to 20 minutes.},

Furthermore, SDS-PAGE proﬁles of total cell protein, antibiotic susceptibility and heavy metal resistance were performed. The results showed that the isolates can grow at pH 4 to 10, salt concentration (0–5\%) and temperature up to 45 °C. The rhizobia associated with Genista microcephala and Argyrolobium uniﬂorum were able to produce different hydrolytic enzymes including cellulose, pectinase and urease, with remarkable tolerance to toxic metals such as zinc, lead, copper, and mercury. Numerical analysis of the phenotypic characteristics revealed that the rhizobial isolates formed four main distinct groups showing high levels of similarity with Gammaproteobacteria. The salt tolerant and heavy metals resistance patterns found among the indigenous rhizobial strains are reﬂecting the environmental stresses pressure and make the strains good candidates for plant successful inoculation in arid areas.},

In the pot experiment four of the strains were used as inoculants, whereas the fifth (HAMBI 1344) represented the indigenous rhizobia of the soil used.

(M. indicus) from 14 different Egyptian soils. These isolates were characterized morphologically and physiologically on the basis of their tolerance to NaCl and pH. Furthermore, the DNA of each rhizobial isolate was analyzed by repPCR amplification fingerprinting using REP, ERIC and BOX A1R primers. Thirty seven rhizobial isolates were obtained from the root nodules of M. indicus. These isolates didn`t absorb Congo- red (CR) when incubated in dark; grew poorly, or not at all, on peptone glucose agar medium containing bromocresol purple (BCP) and acidified the medium suggesting fast-growing rhizobia. Five isolates tolerated NaCl up to 7\%. Rhizobial isolates showed a wide diversity in their pH tolerance. Moreover, PCR with REP and ERIC primer pairs yielded multiple distinct DNA products for each isolate of size ranged from approximately 177 to 3773 bp and 200 to 2921 bp, respectively. BOX A1R primer did not reveal any polymorphism for the isolates. We can conclude that rhizobia isolated from M. indicus from Egyptian soils are both phenotypically and genetically diverse.},

	abstract = {Aloe vera plant offers a sustainable solution for the removal of various pollutants from water. Due to its chemical composition, Aloe vera has been explored as coagulant/ﬂocculant and biosorbent for water treatment. Most of the used materials displayed signiﬁcant pollutants removals depending on the used preparation methods. AV-based materials have been investigated and successfully used as coagulant/ﬂocculant for water treatment at laboratory scale. Selected AV-based materials could reduce the solids (total suspended solids (TSS), suspended solids (SS), total dissolved solids (TDS), and dissolved solids (DS)), turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), heavy metals, and color, with removal percentages varied depending on the coagulant/ﬂocculant materials and on the wastewater characteristics. In the same context, AV materials can be used as biological ﬂocculant for wastewater sludge treatment, allowing good solid–liquid separation and promoting sludge settling. Moreover, using different methods, AV material-based biosorbents were prepared and successfully used for pollutants (heavy metal dyes and phenol) elimination from water. Related results showed signiﬁcant pollutant removal efﬁciency associated with an interesting adsorption capacity comparable to other biosorbents derived from natural products. Interestingly, the enzymatic system of Aloe vera (carboxypeptidase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase) has been exploited to degrade textile dyes. The obtained results showed high promise for removal efﬁciencies of various kinds of pollutants. However, results varied depending on the methodology used to prepare the Aloe vera based materials. Because of its valuable properties (composition, abundance, ecofriendly and biodegradable), Aloe vera may be useful for water treatment.},

	abstract = {Methodology: Water extracts of Aloe vera at three concentrations [100\%, 50\% and 0\% -water (control)] were applied weekly as foliar spray to eggplant seedlings from three weeks after transplanting to the nursery. Plant height, number of leaves per plant and the number of insect holes (feeding punctures) per leaf were recorded.
Results: Eggplant seedlings sprayed with 100\% and 50\% Aloe vera extract were significantly (P=0.05) taller than those sprayed with water (control). Seedlings sprayed with 100\% Aloe vera extract had significantly (P=.05) higher number of leaves than those sprayed with 50\% extract and water (control). However, seedlings sprayed with 50\% extract of Aloe vera and the control showed no significant difference in the number of leaves. The number of insect holes on the leaves of seedlings treated with 50\% and 100\% Aloe vera extract foliar spray were significantly less (P=0.05) than those of the control.
Conclusion: In this study the reduced number of holes caused by insects on leaves of eggplants treated with 50\% and 100\% of Aloe vera foliar spray suggests its effectiveness as a bio-pesticide. The increase in height and number of leaves of eggplants treated with 100\% Aloe vera imply that it could be used as a growth promoter.},

In this Analysis article, we propose rational taxonomic boundaries for high taxa of bacteria and archaea on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence identities and suggest a rationale for the circumscription of uncultured taxa that is compatible with the taxonomy of cultured bacteria and archaea. Our analyses show that only nearly complete 16S rRNA sequences give accurate measures of taxonomic diversity.

	abstract = {The signing authors together with the journal Systematic and Applied Microbiology (SAM) have started an ambitious project that has been conceived to provide a useful tool especially for the scientiﬁc microbial taxonomist community. The aim of what we have called ‘‘The All-Species Living Tree’’ is to reconstruct a single 16S rRNA tree harboring all sequenced type strains of the hitherto classiﬁed species of Archaea and Bacteria. This tree is to be regularly updated by adding the species with validly published names that appear monthly in the Validation and Notiﬁcation lists of the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology. For this purpose, the SAM executive editors, together with the responsible teams of the ARB, SILVA, and LPSN projects (www.arb-home.de, www.arb-silva.de, and www.bacterio.cict.fr, respectively), have prepared a 16S rRNA database containing over 6700 sequences, each of which represents a single type strain of a classiﬁed species up to 31 December 2007. The selection of sequences had to be undertaken manually due to a high error rate in the names and information ﬁelds provided for the publicly deposited entries. In addition, from among the often occurring multiple entries for a single type strain, the best-quality sequence was selected for the project. The living tree database that SAM now provides contains corrected entries and the best-quality sequences with a manually checked alignment. The tree reconstruction has been performed by using the maximum likelihood algorithm RAxML. The tree provided in the ﬁrst release is a result of the calculation of a single dataset containing 9975 single entries, 6728 corresponding to type strain gene sequences, as well as 3247 additional high-fquality sequences to give robustness to the reconstruction. Trees are dynamic structures that change on the basis of the quality and availability of the data used for their calculation.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, as a result of the widespread use of PCR and DNA sequencing, 16S rDNA sequencing has played a pivotal role in the accurate identification of bacterial isolates and the discovery of novel bacteria in clinical microbiology laboratories. For bacterial identification, 16S rDNA sequencing is particularly important in the case of bacteria with unusual phenotypic profiles, rare bacteria, slow-growing bacteria, uncultivable bacteria and culture-negative infections. Not only has it provided insights into aetiologies of infectious disease, but it also helps clinicians in choosing antibiotics and in determining the duration of treatment and infection control procedures. With the use of 16S rDNA sequencing, 215 novel bacterial species, 29 of which belong to novel genera, have been discovered from human specimens in the past 7 years of the 21st century (2001–2007). One hundred of the 215 novel species, 15 belonging to novel genera, have been found in four or more subjects. The largest number of novel species discovered were of the genera Mycobacterium (n = 12) and Nocardia (n = 6). The oral cavity/dental-related specimens (n = 19) and the gastrointestinal tract (n = 26) were the most important sites for discovery and/or reservoirs of novel species. Among the 100 novel species, Streptococcus sinensis, Laribacter hongkongensis, Clostridium hathewayi and Borrelia spielmanii have been most thoroughly characterized, with the reservoirs and routes of transmission documented, and S. sinensis, L. hongkongensis and C. hathewayi have been found globally. One of the greatest hurdles in putting 16S rDNA sequencing into routine use in clinical microbiology laboratories is automation of the technology. The only step that can be automated at the moment is input of the 16S rDNA sequence of the bacterial isolate for identification into one of the software packages that will generate the result of the identity of the isolate on the basis of its sequence database. However, studies on the accuracy of the software packages have given highly varied results, and interpretation of results remains difficult for most technicians, and even for clinical microbiologists. To fully utilize 16S rDNA sequencing in clinical microbiology, better guidelines are needed for interpretation of the identification results, and additional/supplementary methods are necessary for bacterial species that cannot be identified confidently by 16S rDNA sequencing alone.},

	abstract = {Soil nitrogen deficiency is a major factor limiting soybean production. This problem can be alleviated by the use of nitrogen fertilizers which on the other hand adversely affect the environment, are expensive and unaffordable to most peasant farmers. Alternatively, attention is being paid to improving soil nitrogen through the use of environmental friendly biological nitrogen fixation of soybeans in an attempt to develop sustainable cropping systems. There is however inadequate knowledge on estimates of nitrogen fixation by soybean varieties in Kenya. In light of this, growth experiments were designed to investigate biological nitrogen fixation in promiscuous and non promiscuous soybeans. Results from the field experiment showed that the two promiscuous soybean varieties (TGx 1869 and TGx 1893) nodulated better than the non promiscuous Gazelle. Uninoculated Gazelle did not produce any nodule while uninoculated TGx 1869 and TGx 1893 nodulated with indigenous soil rhizobia. Inoculation affected nodulation since there was a significantly higher mean nodule number in inoculated soybeans (highest in TGx 1869 IN – 76) as compared to uninoculated (highest in TGx 1869 – UNC - 21) and(0.0) in nitrogen treated soybeans at podding. Inoculated soybeans had higher shoot dry weight (highest in TGx 1893 IN - 19.30 g) than uninoculated soybeans (highest in TGx 1869 UNC - 13.50 g) .Stover biomass was higher in inoculated soybeans (13.07 g) than in uninoculated treatments (6.91 g). Although there was no significant difference in seed dry weight of inoculated (14.10 g) and uninoculated (8.11 g), inoculated soybeans had higher seed dry weight. The inoculated TGx varieties had higher seed dry weight (TGx 1869 at 12.94 g and TGx 1893 at 14.10 g) than Gazelle (10.12 g). There is need to adopt growing of promiscuous TGx varieties and to exploit biological nitrogen fixation with the view of increasing soybean yields and decreasing overdependence on nitrogen fertilizers for sustainable agriculture.},

Inoculation with Rhizobium strain ISRA 355 and nitrogen fertilizer application (0, 20 or 80 kg N/ha) were significant on shoot and root dry weights mainly. However, pod yields and nodules dry weight were significantly higher in inoculated and nitrogen (20 kg N/ha) treated plots than in uninoculated: +77\% and +300\% respectively. Pod yield was highly improved (+77\%) by the interaction between inoculation with ISRA 355 and nitrogen fertilizer at 20 kg N/ha. Whatever the nitrogen rate was, inoculation of common bean increased the acetylene reduction activity (+156\%) in comparison to the uninoculated plants. Similarly in inoculated treatments, the relative abundance of ureide-N in plants treated with 20 kg N/ha was higher than that of plants unfertilized or amended with 80 kg N/ha for +10\% and +16\% respectively.},

	abstract = {Background: BOX-A1R-based repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR (BOX-PCR) is one of the most used techniques in biogeography studies of microbial isolates. However the traditional separation of BOX-PCR patterns by agarose gel electrophoresis suffers many limitations. The aim of this research was to set up a fluorescent BOX-PCR (F-BOX-PCR) assay in which separation of PCR products is automated in a capillary electrophoresis system. F-BOX-PCR was compared with the traditional BOX-PCR using bacterial strains with different G+C content (Bacillus cereus; Escherichia coli; isolates of the family Geodermatophilaceae). Resolution, discriminatory power and reproducibility were evaluated by assaying different electrophoretic runs, PCR reactions and independent DNA extractions. BOX-PCR and F-BOX-PCR were compared for the analysis of 29 strains of Modestobacter multiseptatus isolated from three different microsites in an altered carbonatic wall from Cagliari, Italy, and 45 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus isolated from 34 samples of the hand-made, yogurt-like product Matsoni, collected in different locations in Georgia.
Results: Fluorophore 6-FAM proved more informative than HEX and BOX-PCR both in agarose gel electrophoresis (p {\textless} 0.004 and p {\textless} 0.00003) and in capillary electrophoresis (compared only with HEX, p {\textless} 2 × 10-7). 6-FAM- and HEX-based F-BOX-PCR respectively detected up to 12.0 and 11.3 times more fragments than BOX-PCR. Replicate separations of F-BOX-PCR showed an accuracy of the size calling of ± 0.5 bp until 500 bp, constantly decreasing to ± 10 bp at 2000 bp. Cluster analysis of F-BOX-PCR profiles grouped M. multiseptatus strains according to the microsite of isolation and S. thermophilus strains according to the geographical origin of Matsoni, but resulted intermixed when a BOX-PCR dataset was used.
Conclusion: F-BOX-PCR represents an improved method for addressing bacterial biogeography studies both in term of sensitivity, reproducibility and data analysis.},

	abstract = {In molecular biology, housekeeping genes are typically constitutive genes that are required for the maintenance of basic cellular function, and are expressed in all cells of an organism under normal and patho-physiological conditions.  Although some housekeeping genes are expressed at relatively constant rates in most non-pathological situations, the expression of other housekeeping genes may vary depending on experimental conditions.The origin of the term "housekeeping gene" remains obscure.  Literature from 1976 used the term to describe specifically tRNA and rRNA. For experimental purposes, the expression of one or multiple housekeeping genes is used as a reference point for the analysis of expression levels of other genes. The key criterion for the use of a housekeeping gene in this manner is that the chosen housekeeping gene is uniformly expressed with low variance under both control and experimental conditions. Validation of housekeeping genes should be performed before their use in gene expression experiments such as RT-PCR. Recently a web-based database of human and mouse housekeeping genes and reference genes/transcripts, named Housekeeping and Reference Transcript Atlas (HRT Atlas), was developed to offer updated list of  housekeeping genes and reliable candidate reference genes/transcripts for RT-qPCR data normalization. This database can be accessed at http://www.housekeeping.unicamp.br.},

	abstract = {Environmental and economic issues have increased the necessity to know better understand the role and fate of nitrogen (N) in crop production systems. Nitrogen is the nutrient most often deficient for crop production in India, and its use can result in substantial economic return for farmers. Losses of nitrogen from the soil and plant system not only reduce soil fertility and plant yield but can also create adverse impacts on the environment. Nitrogen fertilizer useful to crops is partially lost through different mechanisms, including ammonia volatilization, de-nitrification, and leaching. These losses may cause environmental problems like polluting the atmosphere, aquatic systems, and groundwater. However, losses can be reduced a considerable extent by various techniques. Research has been conducted in whole world to minimalize nitrogen fertilizer losses. This paper reviews this information on nitrogen fertilizer losses, indicating management practices for minimizing these losses from the soil‐water system.},

	abstract = {Losses of nitrogen from the soil/plant system not only reduce soil fertility and plant yield but can also create adverse impacts on the environment. Ammonia emissions into the atmosphere contribute to acid rain and represent an indirect source of nitrous oxide greenhouse gas emissions. Nitrate leaching losses into rivers and lakes can cause eutrophication resulting in excessive growth of aquatic weeds and algae, which can reduce ﬁsh populations and the recreational value of the water. Nitrate contamination of drinking water supplies can cause health risks. Legislation that is designed to limit nitrate leaching losses from land has become a constraint on agricultural land use in many countries. Nitrous oxide emissions into the atmosphere contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer and also make a signiﬁcant contribution to climate change. This review describes the nitrogen cycle in temperate soil/plant systems, the processes involved in each of the individual nitrogen loss pathways, the factors affecting the amounts of losses and the methods that are available to reduce these losses. The review has shown that careful management of temperate soil/plant systems using best management practices and newly developed technologies can increase the sustainability of agriculture and reduce its impact on the environment.},

Cumulative changes in regional ecosystem services may lead to global environmental changes. Thus, the soil N status in agriculture is of critical importance to strategize its most efﬁcient use. Nitrogen is also one of the most susceptible macronutrients to environmental loss, such as ammonia volatilization (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, nitrate leaching (NO3), etc. Any form of N losses from agricultural systems can be major limitations for crop production, soil sustainability, and environmental safeguard. There is a need to focus on mitigation strategies to minimize global N pollution and implement agricultural management practices that encourage regenerative and sustainable agriculture. In this review, we identiﬁed the avenues of N loss into the environment caused by current agronomic practices and discussed the potential practices that can be adapted to prevent this N loss in production agriculture. This review also explored the N status in agriculture during the COVID-19 pandemic and the existing knowledge gaps and questions that need to be addressed.},

	abstract = {In agroecosystems, nitrogen is one of the major nutrients limiting plant growth. To meet the increased nitrogen demand in agriculture, synthetic fertilizers have been used extensively in the latter part of the twentieth century, which have led to environmental challenges such as nitrate pollution. Biological nitrogen ﬁxation (BNF) in plants is an essential mechanism for sustainable agricultural production and healthy ecosystem functioning. BNF by legumes and associative, endosymbiotic, and endophytic nitrogen ﬁxation in non-legumes play major roles in reducing the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer in agriculture, increased plant nutrient content, and soil health reclamation. This review discusses the process of nitrogen-ﬁxation in plants, nodule formation, the genes involved in plant-rhizobia interaction, and nitrogen-ﬁxing legume and non-legume plants. This review also elaborates on current research eﬀorts involved in transferring nitrogen-ﬁxing mechanisms from legumes to non-legumes, especially to economically important crops such as rice, maize, and wheat at the molecular level and relevant other techniques involving the manipulation of soil microbiome for plant beneﬁts in the non-legume root environment.},

A variety of data sets are used to construct global N budgets for 1860 and the early 1990s and to make projections for the global N budget in 2050. Regional N budgets for Asia, North America, and other major regions for the early 1990s, as well as the marine N budget, are presented to highlight the dominant ﬂuxes of nitrogen in each region. Important ﬁndings are that human activities increasingly dominate the N budget at the global and at most regional scales, the terrestrial and open ocean N budgets are essentially disconnected, and the ﬁxed forms of N are accumulating in most environmental reservoirs. The largest uncertainties in our understanding of the N budget at most scales are the rates of natural biological nitrogen ﬁxation, the amount of Nr storage in most environmental reservoirs, and the production rates of N2 by denitriﬁcation.},

Watertable depths of 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 m were maintained in field lysimeters at the Ames site, and variable water-table depths were maintained in a subirrigation field at the Ankeny site. Water samples were collected from various soil depths to analyze NO3-N concentrations in groundwater. Concentration of NO3-N in groundwater changed with WTM practices. The lowest NO3-N concentrations were observed under the shallow watertable depths. NO3-N concentrations in groundwater generally decreased with increased depths and time during the growing season under all WTM practices. Crop yields were higher under water-table depths of 0.6 to 0.9 m than under other water-table depths, and corn yields decreased under shallow water-table depths of 0.2 to 0.3 m. Results of this study indicate that WTM practices can be used to substantially reduce the concentrations of NO3-N in groundwater. Results also strongly support the need for further research with WTM practices for water quality and crop production.},

Circulation of anthropogenic Nr in Earth’s atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere has a wide variety of consequences, which are magnified with time as Nr moves along its biogeochemical pathway. The same atom of Nr can cause multiple effects in the atmosphere, in terrestrial ecosystems, in freshwater and marine systems, and on human health. We call this sequence of effects the nitrogen cascade. As the cascade progresses, the origin of Nr becomes unimportant. Reactive nitrogen does not cascade at the same rate through all environmental systems; some systems have the ability to accumulate Nr, which leads to lag times in the continuation of the cascade. These lags slow the cascade and result in Nr accumulation in certain reservoirs, which in turn can enhance the effects of Nr on that environment. The only way to eliminate Nr accumulation and stop the cascade is to convert Nr back to nonreactive N2.},

This symbiotic process has fascinated researchers for over a century, and the positive effects of legumes on soils and their food and feed value have been recognized for thousands of years. Symbiotic nitrogen ﬁxation uses solar energy to reduce the inert N2 gas to ammonia at normal temperature and pressure, and is thus today, especially, important for sustainable food production. Increased productivity through improved effectiveness of the process is seen as a major research and development goal. The interaction between rhizobia and their legume hosts has thus been dissected at agronomic, plant physiological, microbiological and molecular levels to produce ample information about processes involved, but identiﬁcation of major bottlenecks regarding efﬁciency of nitrogen ﬁxation has proven to be complex. We review processes and results that contributed to the current understanding of this fascinating system, with focus on effectiveness of nitrogen ﬁxation in rhizobia.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen is one of the essential plant nutrients and a major factor limiting crop productivity. To meet the requirements of sustainable agriculture, there is a need to maximize biological nitrogen fixation in different crop species. Legumes are able to establish root nodule symbiosis (RNS) with nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria which are collectively called rhizobia. This mutualistic association is highly specific, and each rhizobia species/strain interacts with only a specific group of legumes, and vice versa. Nodulation involves multiple phases of interactions ranging from initial bacterial attachment and infection establishment to late nodule development, characterized by a complex molecular signalling between plants and rhizobia. Characteristically, legumes like groundnut display a bacterial invasion strategy popularly known as “crack-entry’’ mechanism, which is reported approximately in 25\% of all legumes. This article accommodates critical discussions on the bacterial infection mode, dynamics of nodulation, components of symbiotic signalling pathway, and also the effects of abiotic stresses and phytohormone homeostasis related to the root nodule symbiosis of groundnut and Bradyrhizobium. These parameters can help to understand how groundnut RNS is programmed to recognize and establish symbiotic relationships with rhizobia, adjusting gene expression in response to various regulations. This review further attempts to emphasize the current understanding of advancements regarding RNS research in the groundnut and speculates on prospective improvement possibilities in addition to ways for expanding it to other crops towards achieving sustainable agriculture and overcoming environmental challenges.},

              in

              2
              . Of these, 146 are common to rhizosphere growth through to bacteroids. This large number of genes, defined as rhizosphere-progressive, highlights how critical successful competition in the rhizosphere is to subsequent infection and nodulation. As expected, there is also a large group (211) specific for nodule bacteria and bacteroid function. Nodule infection and bacteroid formation require genes for motility, cell envelope restructuring, nodulation signaling, N
              2
              fixation, and metabolic adaptation. Metabolic adaptation includes urea, erythritol and aldehyde metabolism, glycogen synthesis, dicarboxylate metabolism, and glutamine synthesis (GlnII). There are 17 separate lifestyle adaptations specific to rhizosphere growth and 23 to root colonization, distinct from infection and nodule formation. These results dramatically highlight the importance of competition at multiple stages of a

	abstract = {Trong sinh học phân tử, chaperone phân tử là các protein hỗ trợ quá trình "cuộn gấp" hoặc "duỗi mở" hóa trị cũng như lắp ráp hoặc tách các đại phân tử khác. Chaperone có mặt khi các đại phân tử thực hiện các chức năng sinh học bình thường của chúng và hoàn thành chính xác các quy trình gấp và/hoặc lắp ráp. Chaperone có liên quan đặc biệt với quá trình cuộn gấp protein. Protein đầu tiên được gọi là chaperone đã hỗ trợ việc lắp ráp các nucleosome từ các protein histone và DNA; các chaperone lắp ráp, đặc biệt là trong nhân tế bào, liên quan đến việc lắp ráp các tiểu đơn vị đã được cuộn gấp thành các cấu trúc oligomer.Một chức năng chính của chaperone là ngăn chặn chuỗi polypeptide mới được tổng hợp và các tiểu đơn vị đang tập hợp khỏi kết tụ lại thành các cấu trúc không có chức năng. Cũng vì lý do này mà nhiều chaperone, nhưng không có nghĩa là tất cả, là các protein sốc nhiệt vì xu hướng kết tụ này tăng khi các protein bị biến tính bởi stress. Trong trường hợp này, chaperone không truyền thêm bất kỳ thông tin về cách bố trí phân tử để cho protein để cuộn gấp. Tuy nhiên, một số "chaperone bố trí phân tử" đặc hiệu lại chuyển tải thông tin về cấu trúc phân tử (steric) độc nhất cho các protein, nói cách khác, protein sẽ không thể được cuộn gấp lại bình thường nếu không có chaperone. Những protein như vậy phá vỡ nguyên tắc Anfinsen, nguyên tắc này cho rằng: chỉ có trình tự các amino acid là quy định cấu hình không gian của protein.
Các phương pháp tiếp cận khác nhau đã được áp dụng để nghiên cứu cấu trúc, động lực và chức năng của chaperone. Các phép đo sinh hóa hàng loạt đã cho chúng ta biết về hiệu quả gấp protein và ngăn ngừa sự kết tụ khi các chaperone có mặt trong quá trình cuộn gấp protein. Những tiến bộ gần đây trong phân tích đơn-phân tử  đã mang lại những hiểu biết sâu sắc về tính không đồng nhất về cấu trúc của chaperone, các cấu trúc cuộn gấp trung gian và ái lực của chaperone với các chuỗi protein chưa có cấu trúc và có cấu trúc.},

	abstract = {Members of the plant family Leguminosae (Fabaceae) are unique in that they have evolved a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia (a group of soil bacteria that can ﬁx atmospheric nitrogen). Rhizobia infect and form root nodules on their speciﬁc host plants before differentiating into bacteroids, the symbiotic form of rhizobia. This complex relationship involves the supply of C4-dicarboxylate and phosphate by the host plants to the microsymbionts that utilize them in the energy-intensive process of ﬁxing atmospheric nitrogen into ammonium, which is in turn made available to the host plants as a source of nitrogen, a macronutrient for growth. Although nitrogen-ﬁxing bacteroids are no longer growing, they are metabolically active. The symbiotic process is complex and tightly regulated by both the host plants and the bacteroids. The metabolic pathways of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphate are heavily regulated in the host plants, as they need to strike a ﬁne balance between satisfying their own needs as well as those of the microsymbionts. A network of transporters for the various metabolites are responsible for the trafﬁcking of these essential molecules between the two partners through the symbiosome membrane (plant-derived membrane surrounding the bacteroid), and these are in turn regulated by various transcription factors that control their expressions under different environmental conditions. Understanding this complex process of symbiotic nitrogen ﬁxation is vital in promoting sustainable agriculture and enhancing soil fertility.},

They elicit on their host plant the formation of new organs, called nodules, which develop on the roots. A few aquatic legumes, however, can form nodules on their stem at dormant root primordia. The stem-nodulating legumes described so far are all members of the genera Aeschynomene, Sesbania, Neptunia, and Discolobium. Their rhizobial symbionts belong to four genera already described: Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, Sinorhizobium, and Azorhizobium. This review summarizes our current knowledge on most aspects of stem nodulation in legumes, the infection process and nodule development, the characterization and unusual features of the associated bacteria, and the molecular genetics of nodulation. Potential use as green manure in lowland rice of these stem-nodulating legumes, giving them agronomical importance, is also discussed.},

Nitrogen ﬁxation in agriculture can be improved by inoculation of legume crops with suitable rhizobia. Knowledge of the biodiversity of rhizobia and of local populations is important for the design of successful inoculation strategies. Soybeans are major nitrogen-ﬁxing crops in many parts of the world. Bradyrhizobial inoculants for soybean are very diverse, yet classiﬁcation and characterization of strains have long been difﬁcult. Recent genetic characterization methods permit more reliable identiﬁcation and will improve our knowledge of local populations. Forage legumes form another group of agronomically important legumes. Research and extension policies valorizing rhizobial germplasm diversity and preservation, farmer training for proper inoculant use and legal enforcement of commercial inoculant quality have proved a successful approach to promoting the use of forage legumes while enhancing biological N2 ﬁxation. It is worth noting that taxonomically important strains may not necessarily be important reference strains for other uses such as legume inoculation and genomics due to specialization of the different ﬁelds. This article points out both current knowledge and gaps remaining to be ﬁlled for further interaction and improvement of a rhizobial commons.},

This is also valid for Frankia that ﬁx nitrogen both in free-living and in symbiotic conditions. Frankia symbiosis results from interaction between the Frankia bacteria and dicotyledonous plants, that is, actinorhiza. These plants, which are important in forestry and agroforestry, form, together with the legumes (Fabales), a single nitrogen-ﬁxing clade. It has been shown that a receptor-like kinase gene, SymRK, is necessary for nodulation in actinorhizal plants as well as in legumes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Recently, the involvement of isoﬂavonoids as signal molecules during nodulation of an actinorhizal plant was shown. The genome sizes of three Frankia species, Frankia EANpec, ACN14a and CcI3, are different, revealing a relationship between genome size and geographical distribution. Recent genomic sequencing data of Frankia represent genomes from cluster I to IV, indicating that the genome of DgI is one of the smallest genomes in Frankia. In addition, nonsymbiotic Frankiales such as Acidothermus cellulolyticus, Blastococcus saxoobsidens, Geodermatophilus obscurus and Modestobacter marinus have a variety of genome sizes ranging from 2.4 to 5.57 Mb.},

We investigated the potential to develop biochar as a carrier material. Our goal was to evaluate if different biochars perform comparably in supporting rhizobial survival, and what characteristics contribute to their ability to support rhizobial survival. Evaluation included characterization of the biochars, assessment of biochar phytotoxicity, survival of Rhizobium on biochars, and growth chamber evaluation of two biochars as Rhizobium carriers for inoculating pea. Of the original nine biochars evaluated, six supported Rhizobium leguminosarum for 84 days at 4 °C; of this six, two supported numbers {\textgreater}1 × 106 cfu·(g biochar)-1. The only characteristics that correlated with survival were C/N ratio and percent C. The two biochars evaluated delivered R. leguminosarum to pea that initiated nodulation, biomass production, and biomass N at levels higher than a noninoculated control and heat-killed inoculated biochars. We demonstrate that there is considerable potential to develop biochar as a carrier for rhizobial inoculants.},

The legume endosymbionts contain nod and nif genes responsible for nodule formation and nitrogen fixation, respectively, whereas the pathogenic strains carry vir genes responsible for the formation of tumors or hairy roots. The symbiotic and pathogenic strains currently belong to different species of the genus Rhizobium and, until now, no strains able to establish symbiosis with legumes and also to induce tumors or hairy roots in plants have been reported. Here, we report for the first time the occurrence of two rhizobial strains (163C and ATCC11325
              T
              ) belonging to Rhizobium rhizogenes able to induce hairy roots or tumors in plants and also to nodulate Phaseolus vulgaris under natural environmental conditions. Symbiotic plasmids (pSym) containing nod and nif genes and pTi- or pRi-type plasmids containing vir genes were found in these strains. The nodD and nifH genes of the strains from this study are phylogenetically related to those of Sinorhizobium strains nodulating P. vulgaris. The virA and virB4 genes from strain 163C are phylogenetically related to those of R. tumefaciens C58, whereas the same genes from strain ATCC 11325
              T
              are related to those of hairy root-inducing strains. These findings may be of high relevance for the better understanding of plant-microbe interactions and knowledge of rhizobial phylogenetic history.},

	abstract = {Rhizobium phaseoli CFN299 forms nitrogen-fixing nodules in Phaseolus vulgaris (bean) and in Leucaena esculenta. It has three plasmids of 185, 225, and 410 kilobases. The 410-kilobase plasmid contains the nitrogenase structural genes. We have transferred these plasmids to the plasmid-free strain Agrobacterium tumefaciens GMI9023. Transconjugants containing different combinations of the R. phaseoli plasmids were obtained, and they were exhaustively purified before nodulation was assayed. Only transconjugants harboring the 410-kilobase plasmid nodulate P. vulgaris and L. esculenta. Nodules formed by all such transconjugants are able to reduce acetylene. Transconjugants containing the whole set of plasmids from CFN299 nodulate better and fix more nitrogen than the transconjugants carrying only the Sym plasmid. Microscopic analysis of nodules induced by A. tumefaciens transconjugants reveals infected cells and vascular bundles. None of the A. tumefaciens transconjugants, not even the one with the whole set of plasmids from CFN299, behaves in symbiosis like the original R. phaseoli strain; the transconjugants produce fewer nodules and have lower acetylene reduction (25\% as compared to the original R. phaseoli strain) and more amyloplasts per nodule. More than 2,000 bacterial isolates from nodules of P. vulgaris and L. esculenta formed by the transconjugants were analyzed by different criteria. Not a single rhizobium could be detected. Our results show that R. phaseoli plasmids may be expressed in the A. tumefaciens background and direct the formation of effective, differentiated nodules.},

	abstract = {Degraded lands are defined by soils that have lost primary productivity due to abiotic or biotic stresses. Among the abiotic stresses, drought, salinity, and heavy metals are the main threats in tropical areas. These stresses affect plant growth and reduce their productivity. Nitrogen-fixing plants such as actinorhizal species that are able to grow in poor and disturbed soils are widely planted for the reclamation of such degraded lands. It has been reported that association of soil microbes especially the nitrogen-fixing bacteria
              Frankia
              with these actinorhizal plants can mitigate the adverse effects of abiotic and biotic stresses. Inoculation of actinorhizal plants with

              significantly improves plant growth, biomass, shoot and root N content, and survival rate after transplanting in fields. However, the success of establishment of actinorhizal plantation in degraded sites depends upon the choice of effective strains of

Actinorhizal plants are a speciﬁc group of non-leguminous, woody dicots having symbiotic, nitrogen-ﬁxing root nodules that are induced on roots of actinorhizal plant species by soil actinomycetes of the genus Frankia. There is a lack of basic information on actinorhizal plants in Africa compared with other major land masses in the world. Results indicate that most, if not all, African countries and climatic regions have native or introduced actinorhizal species. A synthesis of available information indicates that there are six families, nine genera and 38 reported species of actinorhizal plants in Africa. Of these, 21 species are native and 17 are exotic. The families and corresponding number of species in each genus are: Betulaceae (native Alnus glutinosa (1), exotic Alnus (2)); Casuarinaceae (exotic Casuarina (5), exotic Allocasuarina (3), exotic Gymnostoma deplancheana (1)); Coriariaceae (native Coriaria myrtifolia (1)); Myricaceae (native Morella (19), exotic Morella cerifera (1)); Rhamnaceae (exotic Ceanothus caeruleus (1), exotic Colletia paradoxa (1)); and Elaeagnaceae (exotic Eleaegnus angustifolia (1)). Four reports of native, actinorhizal Ceanothus species in Africa found in the database were determined to be false, instead, being non-actinorhizal species. Widespread plantings of exotic Casuarinaceae have been introduced into tropical and arid zones of Africa as multipurpose trees, especially in arid regions where native species do not occur. There is a diverse assemblage of native species of Morella in Africa, mostly shrubs or small trees, which provide medicine, other useful chemicals and wildlife habitat. Many native Morella species are isolated in montane islands, apparently leading to greater speciation than in Eurasia from where the genus migrated into Africa. The current status and knowledge of African actinorhizal plants indicates a need to focus research on their biogeography, biology, ecology, genetics and use.},

              -ase, although the concentrations required are greater than for repression in free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Klamberger 1977). Various hypotheses have been put forward to account for the repression of N
              2
              -ase activity in the nodule. One hypothesis was that in the presence of exogenous nitrate the plant’s nitrate reductase competed for photosynthate, thereby rendering N
              2
              -ase inactive because it was starved of an energy supply (Oghoghorie \& Pate 1971). Evidence against this was the finding (Chen \& Phillips 1976) that addition of NO
              -
              3
              to pea leaves did not inhibit N
              2
              -ase, and that, if the plants were exposed to an atmosphere enriched with CO
              2
              , the extent of N
              2
              -ase repression when NO
              -
              3
              was applied to the roots was the same as in a normal atmosphere despite the increase in the plants’ photosynthetic capability. Thus, if there is any competition for photosynthate between N
              2
              -ase and nitrate reductase, it must be localized. This model does not explain why NH
              +
              4
              is also efficient as a repressor of N
              2
              -ase. Recently Bisseling, van den Bos \& van Kamman (1978) showed that under conditions where NH
              4
              NO
              3
              repressed N
              2
              -ase activity in pea nodules, it did not affect synthesis of the enzyme. They proposed that the inhibition of N
              2
              -ase in the nodule was indirect, being mediated by an inhibition of the synthesis of leg-haemoglobin.},

	abstract = {Background: Indigenous lactic acid bacteria are well known probiotics having antibacterial activity against potentially pathogenic bacteria. This study aims to characterize the curd lactobacilli for their probiotic potentiality and antagonistic activity against clinical bacteria. Methods: Four curd samples were processed microbiologically for the isolation of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The LAB strains obtained were identiﬁed by conventional methods: cultural aspect, gram-staining, biochemical and sugar fermentation tests. The probiotic properties were justiﬁed with tolerance to low-pH, bile salt and sodium chloride, and the antagonistic activity of the lactobacilli against human pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi) was assessed. Hemolytic activity and antibiotic susceptibility were determined for the lactobacilli isolates, and the cumulative probiotic potential (CPP) values were recorded. Result: Four lactobacilli isolates, L. animalis LMEM6, L. plantarum LMEM7, L. acidophilus LMEM8 and L. rhamnosus LMEM9, procured from the curd samples, survived in low-pH and high bile salt conditions, and showed growth inhibitory activity against the indicator bacteria by agar-well (zone diameter of inhibition; ZDIs: 13.67 ± 0.58–29.50 ± 2.10 mm) and agar overlay (ZDIs: 11.33 ± 0.58–35.67 ± 2.52 mm) methods; the average growth inhibitory activity of lactobacilli ranged 233.34 ± 45.54–280.56 ± 83.67 AU/mL, against the test bacterial pathogens. All the lactobacilli were non-hemolytic and sensitive to most of the test antibiotics. The CPP values of the isolated LAB were recorded as 80–100\%. Conclusion: The curd lactobacilli procured might be used as the valid candidates of probiotics, and bio-therapeutics against bacterial infection to humans.},

This study aimed to evaluate synergism and antagonism between non-pathogenic and pathogenic groups of hydrolytic bacteria isolated from liquid biomedical wastes of hospitals in Semarang. Interactions among indigenous, non-pathogenic, hydrolytic bacterial isolates i.e. Bacillus velezensis R1.3, B. amyloliquefaciens R1.6, B. amyloliquefaciens R1.14, B. velezensis R1.16, B. licheniformis R2.5, and B. amyloliquefaciens R2.9 and with 20 other pathogenic ones were evaluated using overlay and cross streak methods. Observation was based on the formation of inhibition zone as evidence of antagonistic interaction and the absence of this zone as proof of synergic interaction. As results, the 6 non-pathogenic isolates are all synergic among each other, yet antagonistic against most of the 20 pathogenic ones. As conclusion, the obtained 6 non-pathogenic isolates could be mixed as bacterial consortium and used as major component of bioremediation agent of liquid hospital waste.},

Five isolates with nitrogenase activity above 150 nmol hÀ1 mgÀ1 protein were identiﬁed based on phenotypic and 16S rDNA sequences analysis. The strains were identiﬁed as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (PM-1, PM-26), Bacillus fusiformis (PM-5, PM-24) and Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens (PM13), respectively. All the isolates produced indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), in the presence of tryptophan, ranging from 100.4 mg mlÀ1 (PM-13) to 255 mg mlÀ1 (PM-24). The isolate PM-24 (Bacillus fusiformis) exhibiting highest nitrogenase activity (3677.81 nmol hÀ1 mgÀ1 protein) and IAA production (255 mg mlÀ1) has a promising potential for developing as a plant growth promoting rhizobacteria.},

	abstract = {The clearest phenotypic characteristic of microbial cells is their shape, but we do not understand how cell shape affects the dense communities, known as biofilms, where many microbes live. Here, we use individual-based modeling to systematically vary cell shape and study its impact in simulated communities. We compete cells with different cell morphologies under a range of conditions and ask how shape affects the patterning and evolutionary fitness of cells within a community. Our models predict that cell shape will strongly influence the fate of a cell lineage: we describe a mechanism through which coccal (round) cells rise to the upper surface of a community, leading to a strong spatial structuring that can be critical for fitness. We test our predictions experimentally using strains of Escherichia coli that grow at a similar rate but differ in cell shape due to single amino acid changes in the actin homolog MreB. As predicted by our model, cell types strongly sort by shape, with round cells at the top of the colony and rod cells dominating the basal surface and edges. Our work suggests that cell morphology has a strong impact within microbial communities and may offer new ways to engineer the structure of synthetic communities.},

	abstract = {Enrichment of water bodies with nutrients from wastewater is one of the causes of eutrophication to aquatic ecosystems. This study investigated the use of biochar derived from rice husk, coconut husk, and coffee husk in adsorbing nitrates (NO3-N) and nitrites (NO2-N) from slaughterhouse wastewater. It also explored the desorption efficiencies of the adsorbed nutrients to ascertain the applicability of the enriched biochars as slow-release fertilizers. To characterize the physicochemical properties of the biochars, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used. Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), elemental analysis (CHNO) Langmuir and Freundlich, and the isotherm models were employed to fit the experimental equilibrium adsorption data. It was observed that the Langmuir isotherm model has the best fit of NO3- N and NO2- N on all the biochars. And this was based on the coefficient of correlation values. Also, the coconut husk biochar has the highest adsorption capacities of NO3-N and NO2-N at 12.97 mg/g, and 0.244 mg/g, respectively, attributing to its high porosity as revealed by the SEM images. The adsorption capacities for the rice husk char were 12.315 and 0.233 mg/g, while that for coffee husk char were12.08 mg/g and 0.218 mg/g for NO3-N and NO2-N, respectively. The relatively higher amount of NO3-N adsorbed to that of NO2-N could be attributed to its higher initial concentration in the solution than nitrite concentration. The desorption efficiencies of nitrates were 22.4, 24.39, and 16.79 \%, for rice husk char, coconut husk char and coffee husk char, respectively. For the rice husk char, coconut husk char and coffee husk char, the nitrites desorption efficiencies were 80.73, 91.39, and 83.62 \%, respectively. These values are good indicators that the studied biochar can be enriched with NO3- N and NO2- N and used as slow-release fertilizers.},

	abstract = {Pendra provenance is considered to be the origin place of Pongamia pinnata in Chhattisgarh. This forest tree species is an important part of the forest ecosystem of this region. To analyse germination behaviour of Pongamia pinnata, fresh seed from fully grown mature trees were collected. The healthy seeds were soaked in distilled water for 24 hours at room temperature (280C±20C). After presoaking seeds were laid for germination in petriplates having Whatmann filter paper at the laboratory condition. Four replicates of fifty seeds were kept for detailed observation. The time, rate, homogeneity, and synchrony of the germination of seeds were the important aspects for correlating the germination dynamics of Pongamia pinnata. The germination of the seeds started after second day. The emergence of the radicle has been considered as germination for seeds. The 64\% germination has been observed for this experiment. The germination speed advanced and reached to its maximum value on 10th day of germination and the peak value was also maximum on the same day. The daily germination percent was found highest on 8th and 10th day during germination. The average germination value, germination energy index and germination speed were 87.5±5.12, 33.99±1.24 and 18.84 respectively. It was observed that these parameters were linearly correlated and influenced by each other. To find out their rate of dependency correlation matrix was done and it was found that a significant positive correlation (0.84 to 0.99) exist between different germination parameters of Pongamia pinnata at 0.05 level of probability.},

	abstract = {The inhibitory effect of nitrate on nitrogenase activity in root nodules of legume plants has been known for a long time. The major factor inducing changes in nitrogenase activity is the concentration of free oxygen inside nodules. Oxygen availability in the infected zone of nodule is limited, among others, by the gas diffusion resistance in nodule cortex. The presence of nitrate may cause changes in the resistance to O2 diffusion. The aim of this paper is to review literature data concerning the effect of nitrate on the symbiotic association between rhizobia and legume plants, with special emphasis on nitrogenase activity. Recent advances indicate that symbiotic associations of Rhizobium strains characterized by a high nitrate reductase activity are less susceptible to inhibition by nitrate. A thesis may be put forward that dissimilatory nitrate reduction, catalyzed by bacteroid nitrate reductase, significantly facilitates the symbiotic function of bacteroids.},

Screening and selecting the most effective strain is important for biological nitrogen fixation. The present work was undertaken to shed some light on different characteristics, growth and Phytohormone (Indole Acetic Acid) secretion of Rhizobial strains (Rhizobium trifolii, Rhizobium phaseoli, Rhizobium leguminosarum and Bradyrhizobium japonicum).The study revealed that by a series of morphological and biochemical test conducted, all the four strains were gram negative, rod shaped and mucous producing. All the strains grew well at pH 6 and 7, temperature 34 oC and at salt concentration 4\%. Bradyrhizobium japonicum was found to be negative to bromothymol blue test, while all other three strains were positive depicting the former to be slow growing and later to be fast growing. All the strains were resistant to Penicillin and sensitive to Tetracycline. Rhizobium phaseoli produced starch hydrolysis while Rhizobium trifolii was positive in Caesinase test. B. japonicum, R. trifolii and R. phaseoli showed sufficient growth in Urease test and Lysine decarboxylase test. All four strains hydrolyzed lipase and Catalase enzyme. Rhizobium trifolii and Rhizobium phaseoli utilized citrate and in utilization of carbon sources, fast growing strains were able to utilize carbon in comparison to slow growing one. Experiments for Indole Acetic Acid production under aerobic and anaerobic conditions showed maximum production in aerobic condition i.e., 0.4 µg ml-1 by Rhizobium trifolii and 0.6 µg ml-1 by Rhizobium phaseoli. Rhizobium was further applied as a biofertilizer for significant improvement in plant growth and yield.},

	abstract = {Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an important food legume in tropical and subtropical areas because of its ability to adapt to a wide range of agro-climatic regions. Groundnut is usually cultivated in nutrient-poor soil and rain-fed conditions, so average yield tends to be very low relative to potential yield. Even though the nitrogen (N) requirement of groundnut is much higher than cereals due to its high protein content, it has the capacity to meet 60-80\% of N-based requirements through symbiotic N fixation via its root nodules. In its symbiotic relationship with legumes, Rhizobium fixes N, thereby positively impacting the content of this nutrient. This study aimed to isolate, characterize and purify microbial strains of Rhizobium specific to groundnut in a bid to increase this legume’s productivity. The research was conducted in the AICRP-Groundnut laboratory and greenhouse of the Directorate of Research, BCKV, in Kalyani, India during October 2016 to March 2017. Two Rhizobium isolates (RhBC and NRA1) were isolated and selected from groundnut pot cultures. After 45 days, NRA1 produced higher plant biomass, longer roots and shoots, more nodules and higher nodule dry weight than RhBC. NRA1 was selected for a future field trial. The two isolated microbial strains will aid in the screening of additional local isolates to test their effectiveness when co-cultured with local groundnut cultivars to increase yield in soil with low fertility.},

Several heat-tolerant bean-nodulating Rhizobium strains have been isolated previously. However, the basis of their resistance to heat remains unknown. In this study, we compared the effects of heat on symbiotic nitrogen fixation, cell survival, amino acid uptake, and protein synthesis in a heat-tolerant (CIAT899) and a heat-sensitive (CNPAF512) bean-nodulating Rhizobium strain. Acetylene reduction activity of nodulated roots excised from unstressed plants was strongly diminished at 35 or 40°C when plants were nodulated either by CIAT899 or by CNPAF512. When these strains were tested under free-living conditions, survival at 40°C as well as the kinetics of l-[35S]methionine uptake and protein synthesis at 35 and 40°C indicated the higher tolerance of CIAT899 than of CNPAF512 to thermal stress. The synthesis of heat shock proteins was detected in both strains, although at different temperatures. Increased synthesis of 14 heat shock proteins in CNPAF512 and of 6 heat shock proteins in CIAT899 was observed at 40 and 45°C, respectively. A heat shock protein of approximately 21 kDa, of which the synthesis was strongest in both Rhizobium strains upon a temperature shift up, was also conserved in several other bean-nodulating rhizobia. Acquired thermotolerance in CIAT899 was shown to depend on protein synthesis.},

In current research, 71 bacterial isolates were obtained from rice plant and the rhizosphere soil of different paddy fields in Guilan province, Iran. After primitive investigation, 40 bacteria with typical predominant characteristics were selected. By PCR-RFLP of their 16S r-DNA gene, 8 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) totally consisted of 33 isolates were obtained. From all of them, 8 isolates were selected for rice seed germination experiment, then, effective isolates were used for pot experiment to evaluate their ability for promoting rice growth. All of them were able to increase rice growth and yield, but in different potential. These tested isolates were identified as Alcaligenes faecalis (DEp8, O1R4), Pantoea ananatis (AEn1), Bacillus vietnamensis (MR5), Bacillus idriensis (MR2) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia by partial sequencing of their 16S r-DNA gene. Among them, AEn1 and MR5 produced indole-3- acetic acid (IAA) in larger amounts than the other isolates and the isolates AEn1 and O1R4 were able to solubilize phosphate in higher amounts. According to the results obtained, it can be concluded that AEn1, O1R4 and MR5 can be considered as bacterial inoculants to use as alternatives for chemical fertilizers.},

Methods First, we determined the effect of biochar type and rate on early growth of wheat in a soil-less Petri dish bioassay. Second, we investigated the effect of the same biochars on seed germination and early growth of wheat in ten soils with varying texture using a glasshouse bioassay. Finally, we investigated whether these biochars had similar effects on three plant species when grown in one soil.
Results Biochar type and application rate influenced wheat seed germination and seedling growth in a similar manner in both the soil-less Petri dish and soil-based bioassay. Germination and early root growth of mung bean and subterranean clover differed from that of wheat in response to the five biochars.
Conclusions We recommend use of the soil-less Petri dish bioassay as a rapid and simple preliminary test to},

	abstract = {Salvia verbenaca (wild sage) is a commonly cultivated herbal medicine plant, which is native to the Mediterranean climate regions of Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. However, it has become an invasive species in semi-arid and arid regions of southern Australia. Two varieties are present in this region, var. verbenaca and var. vernalis, each of which can be distinguished by differences in morphology and flowering period. Following trials to determine the optimum temperate regime for germination and response to light and dark, seeds of both varieties were tested for their response to variations in pH, moisture stress, salinity, and burial depth. The temperature and light trial was carried out using three different temperature regimes; 30/20˚C, 25/15˚C and 20/12˚C, and two light regimes; 12 hours light/12 hours dark and 24 hours dark, with var. vernalis responding to relatively higher temperatures than var. verbenaca. The germination rate of neither species was significantly inhibited by complete darkness when compared to rates under periodic light exposure. Both varieties germinated at near optimum rates strongly to very strongly in all pH buffer solutions, from pH 5 to pH 10, but they responded most strongly at neutral pH. Var. vernalis showed slightly more tolerance to reduced moisture availability, moderate to strong salinity, and burial depth, compared to var. verbenaca. However, even a fairly shallow burial depth of 2 cm completely inhibited germination of both varieties. Thus, in circumstances where both varieties are present in a soil seedbank, var. vernalis could be expected to establish in more challenging conditions, where moisture is limited and salinity is ‘moderate to high’, implying that it is a more serious threat for invasive weed in conditions where crop plants are already challenged.},

	abstract = {Definition, analysis, and certification of biochar quality are crucial to the agronomic acceptance of biochar. While most biochars have a positive impact on plant growth, some may have adverse effects due to the presence of phytotoxic compounds. Conversely, some biochars may have the ability to adsorb and neutralize natural phytotoxic compounds found in soil. We evaluated the effects of biochars on seedling growth and absorption of allelochemicals present in corn (Zea mays L.) residues. Corn seeds were germinated in aqueous extracts of six biochars produced from varied feedstocks, thermochemical processes, and temperatures. Percent germination and shoot and radicle lengths were evaluated at the end of the germination period. Extracts from the six biochars had no effect on percent germination; however, extracts from three biochars produced at high conversion temperatures significantly inhibited shoot growth by an average of 16\% relative to deionized (DI) water. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons detected in the aqueous extracts are believed to be at least partly responsible for the reduction in seedling growth. Repeated leaching of biochars before extract preparation eliminated the negative effects on seedling growth. Biochars differ significantly in their capacity to adsorb allelochemicals present in corn residues. Germination of corn seeds in extracts of corn residue showed 94\% suppression of radicle growth compared to those exposed to DI water; however, incubation of corn residue extracts with leached biochar for 24 h before initiating the germination test increased radicle length 6 to 12 times compared to the corn residue extract treatments. Germination tests appear to be a reliable procedure to differentiate between effects of different types of biochar on corn seedling growth.},

	abstract = {Given the common use of compost in agriculture, forestry, landscaping and environmental restoration, it is essential that it is perfectly compatible with plant growth and, if possible, that it increases production and quality of plant biomass. It is therefore necessary to evaluate the absence of phytotoxic substances in the compost, which not only informs about its quality, but also on the proper handling of the composting process. Procedures for assessing the phytotoxicity as an indicator of compost maturity can be grouped into two types: a) seed germination and seedling elongation tests with extracts of compost; b) direct seeding tests on substrates made wholly or partly by compost. For the compost to be considered mature, the results of germination and elongation, or plant biomass, should be at least 80-90\% of those obtained in a control. These tests have proven to be sensitive to various toxins, such as salts, organic acids, ammonia, or metals, and can be used to evaluate the process conditions and the degree of stabilization of organic matter, and the suitability of the raw materials. However, the great variability in testing methods make difficult the comparison and interpretation of results, so it is necessary to advance in the standardization of procedures and determine phytotoxicity thresholds for potential phytotoxic compounds in compost.},

In these organs, the bacteria, named rhizobia, can fix atmospheric nitrogen and transfer it to the plant. This special metabolic skill provides to the legumes an advantage when they grow on nitrogen-scarce substrates. While packed with rhizobia, the nodule cells remain alive, metabolically active, and do not develop defense reactions. Here, we review our knowledge on the control of plant immunity during the rhizobia-legume symbiosis. We present the results of an evolutionary process that selected both divergence of microbial-associated molecular motifs and active suppressors of immunity on the rhizobial side and, on the legume side, active mechanisms that contribute to suppression of immunity.},

	abstract = {Biological nitrogen ﬁxation by Rhizobium-legume symbioses represents an environmentally friendly and inexpensive alternative to the use of chemical nitrogen fertilizers in legume crops. Rhizobial inoculants, applied frequently as biofertilizers, play an important role in sustainable agriculture. However, inoculants often fail to compete for nodule occupancy against native rhizobia with inferior nitrogen-ﬁxing abilities, resulting in low yields. Strains with excellent performance under controlled conditions are typically selected as inoculants, but the rates of nodule occupancy compared to native strains are rarely investigated. Lack of persistence in the ﬁeld after agricultural cycles, usually due to the transfer of symbiotic genes from the inoculant strain to naturalized populations, also limits the suitability of commercial inoculants. When rhizobial inoculants are based on native strains with a high nitrogen ﬁxation ability, they often have superior performance in the ﬁeld due to their genetic adaptations to the local environment. Therefore, knowledge from laboratory studies assessing competition and understanding how diverse strains of rhizobia behave, together with assays done under ﬁeld conditions, may allow us to exploit the effectiveness of native populations selected as elite strains and to breed speciﬁc host cultivar-rhizobial strain combinations. Here, we review current knowledge at the molecular level on competition for nodulation and the advances in molecular tools for assessing competitiveness. We then describe ongoing approaches for inoculant development based on native strains and emphasize future perspectives and applications using a multidisciplinary approach to ensure optimal performance of both symbiotic partners.},

In the current study, 22 rhizobial isolates (recovered from 12 different soybean growing sites) and 8 reference strains were selected for biochemical and metabolic characterization. Of 22 isolates, 18 were recovered as fast growing isolates while the rest were slow growing based on bromothymol blue (BTB) test. Unlike earlier belief that rhizobia have no ability to grow on glucose peptone agar medium, in this study, some isolates and some reference strains grew well on this medium. Similarly, when all the isolates were subjected to ketolactose test, some of the isolates were found to show growth on the medium. In contrast, based on C-utilization pattern (15 carbohydrates) a remarkable metabolic diversity was observed among the rhizobial isolates recovered in the study. The clustering and matching analysis showed that most of isolates were matching with slow growing reference strains, a few were with fast growing reference strains and some were found to be unique and hence not matching with any of reference strains. Such analysis suggests the occurrence of metabolically distinct types of rhizobia besides commonly known types (B. japonicum, B. elkanii and S. fredii) of soybean rhizobia and further validation is suggested through 16SrRNA gene sequencing technique.},

It is often used in place of Fehling's solution to detect the presence of reducing sugars. The presence of other reducing substances also gives a positive result. Such tests that use this reagent are called the Benedict's tests. A positive test with Benedict's reagent is shown by a color change from clear blue to brick-red with a precipitate.
Generally, Benedict's test detects the presence of aldehydes, alpha-hydroxy-ketones, and hemiacetals, including those that occur in certain ketoses. Thus, although the ketose fructose is not strictly a reducing sugar, it is an alpha-hydroxy-ketone and gives a positive test because the base in the reagent converts it into the aldoses glucose and mannose. Oxidation of the reducing sugar by the cupric (Cu2+) complex of the reagent produces a cuprous (Cu+), which precipitates as insoluble red copper(I) oxide (Cu2O).It is named after American chemist Stanley Rossiter Benedict.},

The Km value for 3-ketolactose is 2.2 x 10-" M. The 3-ketolactose hydrolase is stimulated by MgH and Mn"+, and inhibited by Zn H. Mercaptoethanol promotes the reaction rate in extracts of strains of biotype 1 but not in extracts of strains of biotype 2.},

The isolated microorganisms were screened in vitro concerning their ability to produce plant growth promoting factors. Eighty-one bacteria were isolated; 45.6\% were positive for the nifH gene and produced at least one of the evaluated plant growth promotion factors. The production of indole-3-acetic acid was observed in 46\% of the isolates, while phosphate solubilization was observed in 86.5\%. No isolates were hydrogen cyanide producers, while 81\% were ammonia producers, 19\% produced cellulases and 2.7\%, chitinases. Microorganisms belonging to the Burkholderia genus were able to inhibit Fusarium moniliforme growth in vitro. Plant growth promoting microorganisms associated with organic sugarcane, especially belonging to Burkholderia, Sphingobium, Rhizobium and Enterobacter genera, can be environmentally friendly alternatives to improve sugarcane production.},

Based on the results of isolation, we observed and evaluated colony and cellular morphology, pigment production, and metabolic activities of twenty-five isolates. Among the isolated bacteria, two bacterial strains (6.2 and 8.2) with high NH4+ concentration in the cultural medium were selected as the best strains for nitrogenfixing ability. The optimal pH and temperature for their growth and nitrogen fixation are 7.0 and 30°C, respectively. Growth is best favored in the presence of sucrose. We sequenced the 16S rRNA gene of selected strains and compared the homology of them in GenBank using BLAST search.

	abstract = {Biochar has been used widely as a soil amendment to improve plant growth, nutrient acquisition, stress tolerance and to improve soil biological, chemical and physical properties. Several studies suggest biochar as a carrier for bacterial inoculants under various climatic and environmental conditions because of the properties that favour microbial life. Biochar is rich in organic carbon, contains nutrients, such as N, P, K, has a high porosity, and high water-holding capacity. In this review, we synthesise results on the effectiveness of biochar as a carrier for inoculum in pot and field conditions. Biochar as a carrier supported a high survival rate of introduced bacteria and significantly increased colonization in the plant rhizosphere. Soil microbes are known to play an essential role in soil biochemical processes, and nutrient cycles; improve plant stress tolerance, and nutrient acquisition through their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, solubilize phosphate, or by enhancing decomposition of plant residues. Moreover, biochar-based inoculants increased root and shoot biomass, nodulation and nutrient uptake of plants in pot and field experiments. Biochar-based inoculants were also effective in enhancing plant growth and grain yield in pot and field experiments. These studies demonstrate that biochar can be considered as a suitable carrier or formulation of bacterial inoculants even in hostile environments and might contribute to replace other commercially used materials successfully. Biochar-based rhizobial inoculants can significantly improve the symbiotic performance of legumes with rhizobia which may reduce N fertilizer demand and thus promote the sustainability of crop production.},

Therefore, in this study, we investigate the eﬃciency of a hydrochar-based rhizobial inoculant (Bradyrhizobium japonicum) on the symbiotic performance of soybean under both greenhouse and ﬁeld conditions. There were positive and signiﬁcant eﬀects of hydrochar-based inoculation on the root and shoot growth of soybean as compared to uninoculated plants grown under irrigated and drought conditions. The drought stress signiﬁcantly inhibited the symbiotic performance of rhizobia with soybean. Soybean inoculated with hydrochar-based B. japonicum produced twofold more nodules under drought stress conditions as compared to plants inoculated with a commercial preparation/inoculant carrier B. japonicum (HISTICK). The N concentration of inoculated plants with hydrochar-based B. japonicum was by 31\% higher than that of un-inoculated plants grown in pots and by 22\% for HISTICK. Furthermore, the soybean treated with hydrochar-based B. japonicum showed higher grain yield of 29\% under irrigated conditions and 40\% higher under rainfed condition compared to un-inoculated plants. In conclusion, the obtained results proved the potential of hydrochar-based B. japonicum inoculant for soybean in terms of increased symbiotic performance and agronomic traits, especially under rainfed conditions.},

	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pseudoreplication&oldid=1057863915},
	abstract = {Pseudoreplication (sometimes unit of analysis error) has many definitions. Pseudoreplication was originally defined in 1984 by Stuart H. Hurlbert as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects with data from experiments where either treatments are not replicated (though samples may be) or
replicates are not statistically independent. Subsequently, Millar and Anderson  identified it as a special case of inadequate specification of random factors where both random and fixed factors are present.  It is sometimes narrowly interpreted as an inflation of the number of samples or replicates which are not statistically independent. This definition omits the confounding of unit and treatment effects in a misspecified F-ratio. In practice, incorrect F-ratios for statistical tests of fixed effects often arise from a default F-ratio that is formed over the error rather the mixed term.
Lazic  defined pseudoreplication as a problem of correlated samples where correlation is not taken into account when computing the confidence interval for the sample mean. For the effect of serial or temporal correlation also see Markov chain central limit theorem.

The problem of inadequate specification arises when treatments are assigned to units that are subsampled and the treatment F-ratio in an analysis of variance (ANOVA) table is formed with respect to the residual mean square rather than with respect to the among unit mean square. The F-ratio relative to the within unit mean square is vulnerable to the confounding of treatment and unit effects, especially when experimental unit number is small (e.g. four tank units, two tanks treated, two not treated, several subsamples per tank). The problem is eliminated by forming the F-ratio relative to the correct mean square in the ANOVA table (tank by treatment MS in the example above), where this is possible. The problem is addressed by the use of mixed models.Hurlbert reported "pseudoreplication" in 48\% of the studies he examined, that used inferential statistics. Several studies examining scientific papers published up to 2016 similarly found about half of the papers were suspected of pseudoreplication. When time and resources limit the number of experimental units, and unit effects cannot be eliminated statistically by testing over the unit variance, it is important to use other sources of information to evaluate the degree to which an F-ratio is confounded by unit effects.},

	volume = {46},
	abstract = {The widespread occurrence of N limitation to net primary production (NPP) and other ecosystem processes, despite the ubiquitous occurrence of N-fixing symbioses, remains a significant puzzle in terrestrial ecology. We describe a simple simulation model for an ecosystem containing a generic nonfixer and a symbiotic N fixer, based on: (1) a higher cosl for N acquisition by N fixers than nonfixers; (2) growth of fixers and fixation of N only when low N availability limits the growtb of nonfixers, and other resources are available; and (3) losses of fixed N from the system only when the quantity of available N exceeds plant and microbial demands. Despite the disadvantages faced by the N fixer under these conditions, N fixation and loss adjust N availability close to the availability of other resources, and biomass and NPP in this simple model can be substantially but only transiently N limited. We then modify the model by adding: (1) losses of N in forms other than excess available N (e.g., dissolved organic N, trace gases pr{\textasciitilde})duced by nitrification); and (2) constraints to the growth and activity of N fixers imposed by differential effects of shading, P limitation, and grazing. The combination of these processes is sufficient to describe an open system, with input from both precipitation and N fixation, that is nevertheless strongly N-limited at equilibrium. This model is useful for exploring causes and consequences of constraints to N fixation, and hence of N limitation, and we believe it will also be useful for evaluating how N fixation and limitation interact with elevated CO2 and other components of global enviromental change.},

	abstract = {A Gram-negative, nonpigmented bacterium designated strain B1 was isolated from a laboratory bioreactor that reduced selenate to elemental red selenium (Se0). 16S rRNA gene–sequence alignment identiﬁed the isolate as a Rhizobium sp. belonging to the Rhizobium clade, which includes R. daejeonense, R. giardinii, R. undicola, R. larrymoorei, R. radiobacter, R. rubi, and R. vitis. R. radiobacter and R. rubi are its closest relatives as indicated by 16S rRNA gene–sequence alignments, which differ from strain B1 by 2.6\% and 2.8\%, respectively. Within this group, strains that show variances [ 0.8\% to 2.2\% have been classiﬁed as different species. The major cellular fatty acids present in the B1 strain were C16:0 (1.8\%), C18:0 (3.38\%), 18:0 3-OH (1.6\%), 18:1 x7c (86.8\%), 19:0 cyclox8c (1.5\%), and summed features 2 (3.8\%) and 3 (1.2\%). The large amount of 18:1 x7c present is constant with members of this group of bacteria, but the small amounts of 16:0, 19:0 cyclox8c, and summed feature 3 shows variance from R. radiobacter and R. rubi. The strain’s phenotypic and biochemical characteristics are consistent with its placement in this genus.},

	abstract = {In field peas, ascochyta blight is one of the most common fungal diseases caused by Didymella pinodes. Despite the high diversity of pea cultivars, only little resistance has been developed until to date, still leading to significant losses in grain yield. Rhizobia as plant growth promoting endosymbionts are the main partners for establishment of symbiosis with pea plants. The key role of Rhizobium as an effective nitrogen source for legumes seed quality and quantity improvement is in line with sustainable agriculture and food security programs. Besides these growth promoting effects, Rhizobium symbiosis has been shown to have a priming impact on the plants immune system that enhances resistance against environmental perturbations. This is the first integrative study that investigates the effect of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viceae (Rlv) on phenotypic seed quality, quantity and fungal disease in pot grown pea (Pisum sativum) cultivars with two different resistance levels against D. pinodes through metabolomics and proteomics analyses. In addition, the pathogen effects on seed quantity components and quality are assessed at morphological and molecular level. Rhizobium inoculation decreased disease severity by significant reduction of seed infection level. Rhizobium symbiont enhanced yield through increased seed fresh and dry weights based on better seed filling. Rhizobium inoculation also induced changes in seed proteome and metabolome involved in enhanced P. sativum resistance level against D. pinodes. Besides increased redox and cell wall adjustments light is shed on the role of late embryogenesis abundant proteins and metabolites such as the seed triterpenoid Soyasapogenol. The results of this study open new insights into the significance of symbiotic Rhizobium interactions for crop yield, health and seed quality enhancement and reveal new metabolite candidates involved in pathogen resistance.},

Recently, legume bacteria (Rhizobium spp.) have been considered as a PGPR for legume as well as non-legumes and have the potential for growth stimulation. A laboratory experiment was conducted to observe the effect of PGPR and Rhizobial inoculation on seed germination, seedling emergence, growth and development of lowland rice variety MR219. The experiment was conducted under laboratory condition using filter paper in Petri dish. The design of the experiment was completely randomized (CRD) with six replicates. The PGPR strains UPMB10 (Bacillus sphaericus), Rhizobium strains SB16, UPMR1006 and UPMR1102 were used in the experiment. Seeds inoculated with those PGPR and Rhizobium strains and the Petri dish were kept in an incubator at 30 ± 2°C for 120 h. The seeds germination and other related attributes were measured. The results suggested that inoculation significantly increased the seedling emergence, seedling vigor, root growth namely root length, root surface area and volume. Among the strains, UPMB10 performed better in seedling growth and strain UPMR1006 produced profuse hair in the radical. The results concluded that PGPR and Rhizobia strain can promote seed emergence and seedling attributes which benefits the early seedling establishment and consequently the crop growth and development.},

Differing amounts of kernels with cracked hulls (0, 5, 10, and 20\%) of the varieties Francis and Wells were mixed with intact kernels, and the number of adult progeny emerging from intact kernels and from kernels with cracked hulls was determined. The Wells variety had been previously classified as tolerant to R. dominica, while the Francis variety was classified as moderately susceptible. Few F1 progeny were produced in Wells regardless of the percentage of kernels with cracked hulls, few of the kernels with cracked hulls had emergence holes, and little frass was produced from feeding damage. At 10 and 20\% kernels with cracked hulls, the progeny production, number of emergence holes in kernels with cracked hulls, and the amount of frass was greater in Francis than in Wells. The proportion of progeny emerging from kernels with cracked hulls increased as the proportion of kernels with cracked hulls increased.

	abstract = {The importance of plant-microbe associations for the invasion of plant species have not been often tested under field conditions. The research sought to determine patterns of change in microbial communities associated with the establishment of invasive plants with different taxonomic and phenetic traits. Three independent locations in Virginia, USA were selected. One site was invaded by a grass (Microstegium vimineum), another by a shrub (Rhamnus davurica), and the third by a tree (Ailanthus altissima). The native vegetation from these sites was used as reference. 16S rRNA and ITS regions were sequenced to study root-zone bacterial and fungal communities, respectively, in invaded and non-invaded samples and analyzed using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME). Though root-zone microbial community structure initially differed across locations, plant invasion shifted communities in similar ways. Indicator species analysis revealed that Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) closely related to Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Ascomycota increased in abundance due to plant invasions. The Hyphomonadaceae family in the Rhodobacterales order and ammonia-oxidizing Nitrospirae phylum showed greater relative abundance in the invaded root-zone soils. Hyphomicrobiaceae, another bacterial family within the phyla Proteobacteria increased as a result of plant invasion, but the effect associated most strongly with root-zones of M. vimineum and R. davurica. Functional analysis using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) showed bacteria responsible for nitrogen cycling in soil increased in relative abundance in association with plant invasion. In agreement with phylogenetic and functional analyses, greater turnover of ammonium and nitrate was associated with plant invasion. Overall, bacterial and fungal communities changed congruently across plant invaders, and support the hypothesis that nitrogen cycling bacteria and functions are important factors in plant invasions. Whether the changes in microbial communities are driven by direct plant microbial interactions or a result of plant-driven changes in soil properties remains to be determined.},

The strain AL1L was found as tan BLP indicating production of tannase with diverse of substrate affinity. The tannase production from the potential strain AL1L was performed in liquid tannic acid broth (0.4\%, w/v). The strain was later identified as Streptomyces sp.

The enzyme was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by dialysis (15 kD cut off). This enzyme, with molecular weight 180 kD shows highest catalytic activity at 35 °C, pH 6 with substrate concentration 0.1 g\%. The purified enzyme possesses 1.4 × 10−3 Km and 11.15 U/ml as Vmax.

	abstract = {SUMMARY
              Why do bacteria have shape? Is morphology valuable or just a trivial secondary characteristic? Why should bacteria have one shape instead of another? Three broad considerations suggest that bacterial shapes are not accidental but are biologically important: cells adopt uniform morphologies from among a wide variety of possibilities, some cells modify their shape as conditions demand, and morphology can be tracked through evolutionary lineages. All of these imply that shape is a selectable feature that aids survival. The aim of this review is to spell out the physical, environmental, and biological forces that favor different bacterial morphologies and which, therefore, contribute to natural selection. Specifically, cell shape is driven by eight general considerations: nutrient access, cell division and segregation, attachment to surfaces, passive dispersal, active motility, polar differentiation, the need to escape predators, and the advantages of cellular differentiation. Bacteria respond to these forces by performing a type of calculus, integrating over a number of environmental and behavioral factors to produce a size and shape that are optimal for the circumstances in which they live. Just as we are beginning to answer how bacteria create their shapes, it seems reasonable and essential that we expand our efforts to understand why they do so.},

The Bayes LSD has the same form as the Fisher LSD, i.e., LSD = sdt, where the Bayes t is not to be confused with Student's t. In the example cited, the Bayes LSD was found to be a more powerful test than the Fisher LSD, Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD), or the Duncan new multiple range (DMR) when F = 45.36, moderate in size and comparative to the Fisher LSD and the DMR when F = 4.43, and conservative and comparable to Tukey's HSD when F = 1.4.

Thuyết ưu sinh rất nổi tiếng vào những thập niên đầu thế kỷ 20. Vào giữa thế kỷ 20 thuyết ưu sinh không còn phổ biến do dính dáng tới Đức Quốc xã. Cả công chúng và vài thành tố của cộng đồng khoa học đều gắn thuyết ưu sinh với những hành động lạm dụng của Phát xít như, "rửa sạch chủng tộc", thí nghiệm trên người và tiêu diệt các nhóm dân tộc "không mong muốn". Tuy nhiên, sự phát triển của các công nghệ gen và công nghệ nhân bản vào cuối thế kỷ 20 đã đặt ra nhiều câu hỏi về ý nghĩa của thuyết ưu sinh và vấn đề đạo đức của nó trong thời hiện đại, lại làm trỗi dậy những mối quan tâm về thuyết ưu sinh.},

	abstract = {Soil fertility and leaching losses of nutrients were compared between a Fimic Anthrosol and a Xanthic Ferralsol from Central Amazônia. The Anthrosol was a relict soil from pre-Columbian settlements with high organic C containing large proportions of black carbon. It was further tested whether charcoal additions among other organic and inorganic applications could produce similarly fertile soils as these archaeological Anthrosols. In the ﬁrst experiment, cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) was planted in pots, while in the second experiment lysimeters were used to quantify water and nutrient leaching from soil cropped to rice (Oryza sativa L.). The Anthrosol showed signiﬁcantly higher P, Ca, Mn, and Zn availability than the Ferralsol increasing biomass production of both cowpea and rice by 38–45\% without fertilization (P {\textless} 0.05). The soil N contents were also higher in the Anthrosol but the wide C-to-N ratios due to high soil C contents led to immobilization of N. Despite the generally high nutrient availability, nutrient leaching was minimal in the Anthrosol, providing an explanation for their sustainable fertility. However, when inorganic nutrients were applied to the Anthrosol, nutrient leaching exceeded the one found in the fertilized Ferralsol. Charcoal additions signiﬁcantly increased plant growth and nutrition. While N availability in the Ferralsol decreased similar to the Anthrosol, uptake of P, K, Ca, Zn, and Cu by the plants increased with higher charcoal additions. Leaching of applied fertilizer N was signiﬁcantly reduced by charcoal, and Ca and Mg leaching was delayed. In both the Ferralsol with added charcoal and the Anthrosol, nutrient availability was elevated with the exception of N while nutrient leaching was comparatively low.},

	abstract = {Saitō no Musashibō Benkei (kanji: 西塔の武蔵坊弁慶, Hán Việt: Tây Tháp Võ Tàng Phường Biện Khánh, 1155-1189), gọi tắt là Benkei (Biện Khánh), một tăng binh (sōhei) đã phục vụ dưới trướng Minamoto no Yoshitsune (源義經). Ông thường được miêu tả là một hộ pháp to tướng với lòng trung thành rất lớn với Yoshitsune và là một đề tài nổi tiếng trong văn hóa dân gian Nhật. Ông được mô tả là một người đàn ông về sức mạnh và lòng trung thành tuyệt vời, và một chủ đề phổ biến trong dân gian Nhật Bản.
Thanh naginata (thế đao) mà ông dùng để chiến đấu tên là "Iwatooshi".

Benkei bị gọi là Oniwaka (鬼若) khi còn trẻ vì vẻ ngoài xấu xí của ông. Ông là một người kì quái, có câu chuyện kể rằng mẹ của ông bị khó sinh khi sinh ra ông. Trong Gekeiki có nói rằng mẹ của ông đã mang thai 18 tháng trước khi sinh ra ông. Khi Benkei được sinh ra, ông trông không giống một đứa bé sơ sinh gì cả, ông trông giống như một đứa trẻ đã 2- 3 tuổi, răng và tóc đều đã mọc. Cha ông nghĩ ông là đứa bé bị nguyền rủa và định giết chết ông. Tuy nhiên, mẹ của ông đã ngăn cha ông lại, và cha ông cho phép ông được sống nhưng với điều kiện Benkei không được sống trong nhà. Vì vậy Benkei đã bị đuổi khỏi nhà khi còn bé và đã phải sống tự lập từ đó.
Lên 6 tuổi, ông bị bệnh đậu mùa và từ đấy khuôn mặt trở nên đen sạm, điều này giải thích cho vẻ ngoài xấu xí và vóc dáng to lớn của ông. Do Benkei bị tách ra khỏi mẹ từ rất bé, dẫn tới Benkei có tính cách rất bạo lực từ khi còn trẻ.
Cuối cùng Benkei trở thành một yamabushi 山伏 (tăng binh) lúc 17 tuổi và nhận được nhiện vụ bảo vệ cầu Gojo ở Kyoto. Ông là một người mang trên mình nhiệm vụ, cố gắng thu thập những thanh kiếm từ các Samurai, những người muốn đi qua cây cầu. Kĩ năng của ông đã đạt tới đỉnh cao, truyền thuyết nói rằng một nhát của Benkei là một người sẽ chết. Benkei tiếp tục chến đấu và nổi danh vì chiến thắng trong tất cả các trận chiến ông tham gia, cuối cùng ông thu được 999 thanh kiếm. Tuy nhiên, một ngày đẹp trời, vào trận chiến thứ 1000 của mình, ông đã thua một Samurai trẻ. Ông đã thua Minamoto no Yoshitsune. Kể từ đó, ông thề trung thành với Yoshitsune và trở thành thuộc hạ của ngài.
Vào những năm cuối cùng của Benkei và Yoshitsune, khi Yoshitsune bị Fujiwara no Yasuhira phản bội và quyết định seppuku (tự mổ bụng), Benkei đứng trên cây cầu ngoài dinh thự nhà Yoshitsune. Yoshitsune ra lệnh cho Benkei, thuộc hạ cuối cùng còn sống sót của ngài đứng canh tại cây cầu vào dinh thự, trong khi ngài thực hiện seppuku.
Với ý chí mạnh mẽ, Benkei đã chiến đấu liên tục, người ta nói rằng trong sự kiện này, ông đã giết chết hơn 300 tên lính với thanh Naginata của ông- Iwatooshi. Những tên lính đã làm tất cả có thể với Benkei nhưng ông là một người khó nhằn. Benkei đã hiến dâng tất cả, không màng đến vết thương của mình, ông vẫn tiếp tục chiến đấu. Sau một thời gian, lính địch sợ hãi Benkei, và bắt đầu giữ khoảng cách với ông và phải sử dụng tấn công tầm xa. Chúng bắn những trận mưa tên vào Benkei và làm Benkei bị thương.
Tuy nhiên, Benkei vẫn đứng đó, ngẩng cao đầu, mặc dù những mũi tên cắm trên người ông. Những tên lính địch sớm nhận thấy Benkei đã bất động. Ông ta chỉ đứng đó, cầm Iwatooshi trong tay. Những tên lính cẩn thận tiếp cận ông và nhận ra rằng Benkei đã chết rồi. Benkei chết khi đang đứng. Cái chết của Benkei được biết đến là " Cái chết đứng của Benkei" Benkei no Tachi Oujou (弁慶の立往生).
Mặc dù Benkei đã hi sinh, nhưng ông đã hoàn thành sứ mệnh của mình- ngăn chặn bất cứ ai cản trở Yoshitsune thực hiện seppuku. Thật không may là thanh naginata Iwatooshi đã bị mất tích cho đến ngày nay, không ai biết nó trông như thế nào, ngoại trừ những thông tin trong Gikeiki.},

Deming là người đi tiên phong trong quản lý chất lượng. Ông đưa ra hệ thống lý thuyết về kiểm soát chất lượng bằng phương pháp thống kê, từ đó hình thành một triết lý mới về quản lý công việc. Ông đã phát triển các kỹ thuật lấy mẫu thống kê mà ngày nay Cục Điều tra dân số Hoa Kỳ và Cục Thống kê Lao động Hoa Kỳ vẫn đang sử dụng. Ông ứng dụng phương pháp Kiểm soát quá trình thống kê của Walter A. Shewhart vào tính toán và quản lý tiến trình công việc. Ông phát triển cái mà ông gọi là Chu trình Shewhart thành chu trình PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act tức là Lập kế hoạch-Làm-Nghiên cứu-Cải tiến) hay Chu trình PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act tức là Lập kế hoạch-Thực hiện-Kiểm tra-Điều chỉnh). Nhằm khôi phục kinh tế Nhật Bản sau thế chiến II, Hiệp hội Kỹ sư và Khoa học gia Nhật Bản mời Deming sang Tokyo giảng Kiểm soát Chất lượng bằng Thống kê (Quản trị chất lượng sản phẩm bằng thống kê). Việc các nhà lãnh đạo và quản lý Nhật Bản áp dụng lý thuyết của Deming vào khôi phục kinh tế sau chiến tranh được cho là nguồn gốc của phép lạ thần kỳ kinh tế hậu chiến của Nhật Bản, chỉ trong hơn một thập kỷ, từ đống tro tàn của chiến tranh phát triển trở thành nền kinh tế mạnh thứ hai trên thế giới vào những năm 1960.},

	abstract = {Biological systems are highly regulated. They are also highly resistant to sudden perturbations enabling them to maintain the dynamic equilibrium essential for sustenance of life. This robustness is conferred by regulatory mechanisms that influence the activity of enzymes/proteins within their cellular context, to adapt to changing environmental conditions. However, the initial rules governing the study of enzyme kinetics were tested and implemented for mostly cytosolic enzyme systems that were easy to isolate and/or recombinantly express. Moreover, these enzymes lacked complex regulatory modalities. Now, with academic labs and pharmaceutical companies turning their attention to more complex systems (for instance, multi-protein complexes, oligomeric assemblies, membrane proteins and post-translationally modified proteins), the initial axioms defined by MichaelisMenten (MM) kinetics are rendered inadequate and the development of a new kind of kinetic analysis to study these systems is required. The current review strives to present an overview of enzyme kinetic mechanisms that are atypical and, oftentimes, do not conform to the classical MM kinetics. Further, it presents initial ideas on the design and analysis of experiments in early drug-discovery for such systems, to enable effective screening and characterisation of small-molecule inhibitors with desirable physiological outcomes.},

This insight gives rise to a new R package that allows you to smoothly apply this strategy, without having to worry about the type of structure in which your data is stored.

The paper includes two case studies showing how these insights make it easier to work with batting records for veteran baseball players and a large 3d array of spatio-temporal ozone measurements.},

	abstract = {Gel electrophoresis, a widely used technique to separate DNA according to their size and weight, generates images that can be analyzed automatically. Manual or semiautomatic image processing presents a bottleneck for further development and leads to reproducibility issues. In this paper, we present a fully automated system with high accuracy for analyzing DNA and proteins. The proposed algorithm consists of four main steps: automatic thresholding, shifting, filtering, and data processing. Automatic thresholding, used to equalize the gray values of the gel electrophoresis image background, is one of the novel operations in this algorithm. Enhancement is also used to improve poor quality images that have faint DNA bands. Experimental results show that the proposed technique eliminates defects due to noise for average quality gel electrophoresis images, while it also improves the quality of poor images.},

	abstract = {Pooled testing (also known as group testing), where diagnostic tests are performed on pooled samples, has broad applications in the surveillance of diseases in animals and humans. An increasingly common use case is mo­ lecular xenomonitoring (MX), where surveillance of vector-borne diseases is conducted by capturing and testing large numbers of vectors (e.g. mosquitoes). The R package PoolTestR was developed to meet the needs of increasingly large and complex molecular xenomonitoring surveys but can be applied to analyse any data involving pooled testing. PoolTestR includes simple and flexible tools to estimate prevalence and fit fixed- and mixed-effect generalised linear models for pooled data in frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. Mixed-effect models allow users to account for the hierarchical sampling designs that are often employed in surveys, including MX. We demonstrate the utility of PoolTestR by applying it to a large synthetic dataset that emulates a MX survey with a hierarchical sampling design.},

Current HIV screening of blood that has been donated for transfusion involves the testing of individual blood units with an inexpensive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test and followup with a more accurate and more expensive western blot test for only those units that tested positive. Our cost-effective pooling strategy would enhance current methods by making it possible to accurately estimate the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the initial screening test, and the proportion of defective units that have passed through the system. We also provide a method of estimating the distribution of prevalences for the characteristic throughout the population or subpopulations of interest.},

	abstract = {Blindness is defined as presenting visual acuity worse than 3/60 in the better eye. Its highest proportion has been conforming to the developing countries such as Ethiopia. So, timely information is crucial to design strategies. However, the study on the magnitude of blindness in Ethiopia was outdated which means it was conducted in 2005–2006. Therefore, this study was proposed to estimate the pooled prevalence of blindness in Ethiopia.
            Databases like PubMed, Cochrane library, Google Scholar and references of retrieved articles were used to search for articles. A standard data extraction approach was employed and presented using Preferred Reporting of Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale quality assessment tool was used to evaluate the quality of studies. Analysis held using STATA V.11. The funnel plot and Egger’s regression test were applied to check for the potential sources of bias. Heterogeneity among the studies was tested using I² statistics that have been calculated and compared with the standard. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis were done to identify the potential sources of heterogeneity. Estimation of blindness was carried out using Duval and Twee die’s trim and fill analysis. The pooled prevalence of blindness in Ethiopia is found to be 1.18\% (95\% CI 0.650\% to 1.706\%). Blindness is among the main public health difficulties in Ethiopia. So, it demands up-to-date strategies and its implementation, preventive and curative eye care service with affordable and accessible interventions, and evidence-based advocacy. The trial Registration Number is CRD42021268448.},

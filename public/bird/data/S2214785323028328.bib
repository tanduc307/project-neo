abstract = {Biochar is a sustainable material that finds numerous applications due to its high surface area and other structural characteristics. This paper reviews the use of agricultural biomass for biochar generation. Different agricultural biomass feedstocks used for the generation of biochar, bio-oil and bio-gas have been summarized. Different techniques for the generation of biochar from agricultural biomass and their advantages and limitations are critically discussed. Different applications of biochar have been discussed and some emerging applications have been highlighted. Finally, probable future research and the less explored area have been highlighted to provide some direction to the prospective researchers working in this field.}

TI  - A scientometric review of biochar research in the past 20 years (1998–2018)

AB  - Biochar is the carbon-rich product obtained from the thermochemical conversion of biomass under oxygen-limited conditions. Biochar has attained extensive attention due to its agronomical and environmental benefits in agro-ecosystems. This work adopts the scientometric analysis method to assess the development trends of biochar research based on the literature data retrieved from the Web of Science over the period of 1998–2018. By analysing the basic characteristics of 6934 publications, we found that the number of publications grew rapidly since 2010. Based on a keyword analysis, it is concluded that scholars have had a fundamental recognition of biochar and preliminarily found that biochar application had agronomic and environmental benefits during the period of 1998–2010. The clustering results of keywords in documents published during 2011–2015 showed that the main research hotspots were “biochar production”, “biochar and global climate change”, “soil quality and plant growth”, “organic pollutants removal”, and “heavy metals immobilization”. While in 2016–2018, beside these five main research hotspots, “biochar and composting” topic had also received greater attention, indicating that biochar utilization in organic solid waste composting is the current research hotspot. Moreover, updated reactors (e.g., microwave reactor, fixed-bed reactor, screw-feeding reactor, bubbling fluidized bed reactor, etc.) or technologies (e.g., solar pyrolysis, Thermo-Catalytic Reforming process, liquefaction technology, etc.) applied for efficient energy production and modified biochar for environmental remediation have been extensively studied recently. The findings may help the new researchers to seize the research frontier in the biochar field.

TI  - Synergistic effects of biochar/microbial inoculation on the enhancement of pig manure composting

IS  - 1
AB  - With the aim to comparatively investigate the effect of the addition of additives such as biochar (BC), microbial inoculation (MI) and biochar/microbial inoculation (BCMI) on composting enhancement, nitrogen conservation, greenhouse gas emissions, the quality improvement of pig manure compost were comparatively investigated in a 42-day aerobic pig manure composting experiment. The results showed that the duration of the thermophilic stage, the degradation of organic matter and the detoxification of the compost were enhanced in the BC, MI and BCMI treatments compared with those in the control (without additive). Moreover, the content of total Kjeldahl nitrogen in the BC, MI and BCMI treatments was increased by 38.1, 48.9 and 59.0%, respectively, through the reduction of NH3 volatilization and N2O production, which were higher than those of the control (31.8%). A reduction in CH4 release during composting was not observed with the MI and BCMI treatments. Following 42 days of composting, the final product of the three treatments exhibited acceptable potential for use as a fertilizer in agriculture; the BCMI treatment showed an especially synergistic effect on pig manure composting enhancement.

TI  - Biochar compost blends facilitate switchgrass growth in mine soils by reducing Cd and Zn bioavailability
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 97
EP  - 114
VL  - 1
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochars have the potential to reclaim mine-impacted soils; however, their variable physico-chemical properties incite speculation about their successful remediation performance. This investigation examined the capability of biochars produced from three different feedstocks along with a compost blend to improve switchgrass growth conditions in a mine-impacted soil by examining influences on soil pH, grass metal contents, and soil-extractable metal concentrations. Cadmium (Cd)- and zinc (Zn)-contaminated mine soil was collected from a site near Webb City, Missouri, USA—a location within the Tri-State Mining District. In a full factorial design, soil was treated with a 0%, 2.5%, and 5% (w/w) compost mixture (wood chips + beef cattle manure), and 0%, 2.5% and 5% of each biochar pyrolyzed from beef cattle manure, poultry litter, and lodgepole pine feedstocks. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum, ‘Cave-In-Rock’ variety) was grown in a greenhouse for 50 days and the mass of shoots (above-ground biomass) and roots was assessed, while soil pH, deionized H2O- and 0.01 M CaCl2-extractable Cd and Zn concentrations were measured. Poultry litter biochar and compost had the greatest ability to raise soil pH (from 4.40 to 6.61), beef cattle manure biochar and compost moderately raised pH (from 4.4 to 5.92), and lodgepole pine biochar and compost weakly raised pH (from 4.40 to 5.05). Soils treated with beef cattle manure biochar, poultry litter biochar significantly reduced deionized H2O- and 0.01 M CaCl2-extractable Cd and Zn concentrations, while lodgepole pine biochar-treated soils showed mixed results. Switchgrass shoot and root masses were greatest in soil treated with compost in combination with either beef cattle manure biochar or poultry litter biochar. Soils treated with 5% beef cattle manure biochar + 5% compost had greater reductions in total Cd and Zn concentrations measured in switchgrass shoots and roots compared to the other two treatments. The three biochars and compost mixtures applied to heavy metal, mine-impacted soil had considerable performance dissimilarities for improving switchgrass productivity. Switchgrass growth was noticeably improved after treatment with the compost in combination with biochar from beef cattle manure or poultry litter. This may be explained by the increased soil pH that promoted Zn and Cd precipitation and organic functional groups that reduced soil-available heavy metal concentrations. Our results imply that creating designer biochars is an important management component in developing successful mine-site phytostabilization programs.

TI  - Biochar improves diary pasture yields by alleviating P and K constraints with no influence on soil respiration or N2O emissions
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 115
EP  - 126
VL  - 1
IS  - 1
AB  - Dairy pastures can be a major source of soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions due to the combination of intensive nitrogen (N) fertiliser use and high soil water content, from either rainfall and/or irrigation. Biochar application is a promising approach to lower soil greenhouse gas emissions, particularly under high soil moisture conditions where denitrification is the primary N-transformation pathway. In a replicated field trial, we evaluated the effects of two contrasting biochars derived from poultry litter and from hardwood on soil N2O emissions, soil ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3−) status, pasture productivity and herbage nutrient content. A liming treatment to mimic the liming equivalence of the poultry litter biochar was used to separate any effects observed from changes in soil pH. To further separate the effects of biochars on soil N status, N2O emissions and pasture N uptake, high and low N fertiliser doses (annual application of 672 kg N ha−1, 336 kg N ha−1) were superimposed across all of the treatments. The N fertiliser dose had no significant impact on pasture yield. Application of poultry litter biochar resulted in significant increases in pasture productivity under both high and low N inputs. This was achieved by alleviating soil P, and possibly K nutritional constraints that are typical in Australian Ferralsols. Under the high N fertiliser dose, emissions of N2O from the treatments and control were not significantly different (p > 0.05) and ranged between 1.14 and 1.78 kg N2O-N ha−1 across the 11-month study. The low N dose resulted in significantly lower emissions of N2O of between 0.80 and 0.84 kg N2O-N ha−1, but biochar had no significant effect on net emissions across the season. The lack of impact of biochar on N2O emissions was attributed to the relatively dry conditions over the trial period resulting in nitrification being the most likely N-transformation pathway. During brief episodes of high soil moisture, peak emissions from the biochar plots were lower than from the control or lime treatment, but these differences did not impact on the emission budget over the 11-month sampling campaign.

TI  - Biochar-based materials and their applications in removal of organic contaminants from wastewater: state-of-the-art review
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 45
EP  - 73
VL  - 1
IS  - 1
AB  - As a class of famous carbon materials, biochars (BCs) and their derivative materials with excellent physicochemical properties and diversified functionalities present great potential in wastewater treatment fields. This review focuses on the latest development in reported biochar-based materials as superior adsorbents or catalysts for removing harmful organic contaminants from wastewater. The construction and properties of biochar-based materials are briefly introduced at the beginning. As one of the major factors affecting the properties of BCs, the wide diversity of feedstocks, such as agricultural and forest residues, industrial by-products as well as municipal wastes, endows BCs different chemical compositions and structures. Woody and herbaceous BCs usually have higher carbon contents, larger surface areas and strong aromaticity, which is in favor of the organic contaminant removal. Driven by the desire of more cost-effective materials, several types of biochar-based hybrid materials, such as magnetic BC composites (MBC), nanometal/nanometallic oxides/hydroxide BC composites and layered nanomaterial-coated BCs, as well as physically/chemically activated BCs, have also been developed. With the help of foreign materials, these types of hybrid BCs have excellent capacities to remove a wide range of organic contaminants, including organic dyestuff, phenols and chemical intermediates, as well as pharmaceutically active compounds, from aquatic solutions. Depending on the different types of  biochar-based materials, organic contaminants can be removed by different mechanisms, such as physical adsorption, electrostatic interaction, π–π interaction and Fenton process, as well as photocatalytic degradation. In summary, the low cost, tunable surface chemistry and excellent physical–chemical properties of BCs allow it to be a potential material in organic contaminant removal. The combination of BCs with foreign materials endows BCs more functionalities and broader development opportunities. Considering the urgent demand of practical wastewater treatment, we hope more researches  will focus on the applications and commercialization of biochar-based materials.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 89
EP  - 96
VL  - 1
IS  - 1
AB  - Converting waste biomass into value-added biochar has been considered as a green and sustainable strategy for resource management and pollution control. In this study, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) modified biochars (BCs) were produced through one-pot pyrolysis of urea and hickory chips in differential ratios at 520 °C. The resulting BC/g-C3N4 composites were evaluated in laboratory for their physicochemical, adsorptive, and photocatalytic properties. The characterization tests showed the successful synthesis of the BC/g-C3N4 composites that introduced g-C3N4 structure, N-containing surface functional groups, reduced surface area, and better thermal stability to the biochar. After modification, the BC/g-C3N4 composites showed better adsorption ability to reactive red 120 (RR120) than the pristine BC, due to the strong electrostatic attrition between N-containing functional groups of g-C3N4 on biochar surface and anionic RR120. The BC/g-C3N4 composites also inherited g-C3N4’s photocatalytic activity, which is visible light responsive to generate free radicals for RR120 degradation. In addition, the composites with higher urea modification ratios were more effective in the degradation of RR120. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility and promising potential of combining biochar and photocatalyst for the removal of aqueous dye. Because of the synergistic adsorption and photodegradation ability, BC/g-C3N4 composites present a novel and cost-effective solution for the removal of aqueous dye and other photodegradable contaminants under natural conditions.

AB  - After entering the twenty-first century, biochar has become a focal point of multidisciplinary research because of its special characteristics, broad application, and promising development prospects. Basic and applied research on the application of biochar in the areas of agriculture, environment, and energy have increased dramatically in the face of food security, environmental pollution, and energy shortage. Although there are some disputes about biochar research, many studies have demonstrated the importance of biochar research from the perspective of scientific advancement and practical application. This paper briefly recalls the history of biochar application; introduces research progress on the basic characteristics of biochar and its associated production technologies; summarizes the research status and existing problems of biochar application in the areas of agriculture, environment, and energy; and analyzes the potential problems and development trends of biochar research in the future.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 3
EP  - 22
VL  - 1
IS  - 1
AB  - Application of biochar to soils changes soil physicochemical properties and stimulates the activities of soil microorganisms that influence soil quality and plant performance. Studying the response of soil microbial communities to biochar amendments is important for better understanding interactions of biochar with soil, as well as plants. However, the effect of biochar on soil microorganisms has received less attention than its influences on soil physicochemical properties. In this review, the following key questions are discussed: (i) how does biochar affect soil microbial activities, in particular soil carbon (C) mineralization, nutrient cycling, and enzyme activities? (ii) how do microorganisms respond to biochar amendment in contaminated soils? and (iii) what is the role of biochar as a growth promoter for soil microorganisms? Many studies have demonstrated that biochar-soil application enhances the soil microbial biomass with substantial changes in microbial community composition. Biochar amendment changes microbial habitats, directly or indirectly affects microbial metabolic activities, and modifies the soil microbial community in terms of their diversity and abundance. However, chemical properties of biochar, (especially pH and nutrient content), and physical properties such as pore size, pore volume, and specific surface area play significant roles in determining the efficacy of biochar on microbial performance as biochar provides suitable habitats for microorganisms. The mode of action of biochar leading to stimulation of microbial activities is complex and is influenced by the nature of biochar as well as soil conditions.

VL  - 1

AB  - The impacts of biochar addition with nitrogen fertilizer (Urea-N) on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and grain yields are not comprehensively understood. Therefore, we designed a field experiment in an intensive rice–wheat cropping system located in the Taihu Lake region of China and measured CH4 and N2O emissions for 2 consecutive years to examine the impacts of biochar combined with N-fertilizer on rice production and GHG flux. Three field experimental treatments were designed: (1) no N-fertilizer application (N0); (2) 270 kg N ha−1 application (N270); and (3) 270 kg N-fertilizer ha−1 plus 25 t ha−1 biochar application (N270 + C). We found that, compared with urea application alone, biochar applied with Urea-N fertilizer increased N use efficiency (NUE) and resulted in more stable growth of rice yield. In addition, biochar addition increased CH4 emissions by 0.5–37.5% on average during the two consecutive rice-growing seasons, and decreased N2O–N loss by ~ 16.7%. During the first growing season, biochar addition did not significantly affect the global warming potential (GWPt) or the greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) of rice production (p > 0.05). By contrast, during the second rice-growing season, biochar application significantly increased GWPt and GHGI by 28.9% and 18.8%, respectively, mainly because of increased CH4 emissions. Our results suggest that biochar amendment could improve grain yields and NUE, and increased soil GWPt, resulting in a higher potential environmental cost, but that biochar additions enhance exogenous carbon sequestration by the soil, which could offset the increases in GHG emissions.

AB  - Little is known on the effects of biochar on N uptake and amino acid variability in crops such as winter rye and narrow-leafed lupine despite the fact that amino acids are important indicators, for food quality and plant stress. N uptake of both crops showed contrasting results when treated with different biochar fertilizers. Total amino acid contents referred to total nitrogen generally tend to decrease in rye grains in the presence of biochar; whereas lupine seeds were more or less unaffected by biochar combined with mineral fertilizer or compost. In lupine seeds, total amino acid contents significantly increased when biochar was mixed with digestate but decreased when mixed with fermented digestate. Lysine, one of the most limiting amino acids in cereals, reached the recommended value of 4 g kg−1 in rye grain for most biochar fertilizers. In lupine seeds, lysine decreased when biochar had been applied but were still in the recommended range when used as animal feed. Proline, an indicator for plant stress, significantly decreased (− 49%) in rye when 2 Mg biochar ha−1 was added in combination with mineral fertilizer. In contrast, proline increased when biochar was added to organic (digestate and compost) fertilizers (up to 43%). Further biochar research should focus much more on food quality, which is a key challenge for global food production.

AB  - Agriculture under changing climate scenario is facing major challenges of water scarcity and resource imbalances. Crop water productivity (WP) may act as an indicator of crop responses to water limitation. Organic amendments such as biochar and manure application to soil are suggested for improving soil quality and reducing water requirements from agricultural sector. However, studies exploring the impact of biochar as sole or in combination with organic and/or chemical fertilizers on WP in dry tropical agro-ecosystems are limited. In this study, we observed the effect of rice-husk ash (RHA, biochar) along with farm-yard manure (FYM) and chemical fertilizers (CF) under varying water conditions on soil hydro-physical properties, yield and WP of wheat crop. Water-filled pore space (WFPS), grain and straw yield, irrigation and total water productivity varied significantly (at P < 0.001) at treatment level. Grain and straw yield were found higher under sole and combined CF applied treatments. Sole and combined RHA and FYM amendment improved water holding capacity (WHC) and WFPS, whereas a decrease in crop yield was observed as compared to the control. Irrigation and total water productivity were found higher under combined RHA + FYM and sole CF treatments with reduced water supply (except sole CF) as compared to control and sole RHA treatments with full water irrigation. Crop water productivity was found positively correlated with grain and straw yields, however, significant correlations were not observed with WHC and WFPS. Results indicate that increasing soil hydro-physical properties in silty-loam soil may hinder crop yield and WP under sole biochar applied soils. Overall, the implications of the study would help in devising agro-management practices based on combined application of RHA and FYM with reduced chemical fertilizer and water inputs to mitigate the impacts of climate change without compromising crop yield in the highly vulnerable dry tropical agro-ecosystem of India. Moreover, long-term studies are needed in these ecosystems to identify the appropriate agricultural package for mitigating the forthcoming water scarcity conditions.

VL  - 1
IS  - 2
AB  - In this study, we report on the extraction, characterization, and potential applications of colloidal biochar derived from pyrolyzed wood—an untapped source of carbonaceous particles. A series of characterizations was performed on biochar colloids to unravel their colloidal properties and surface chemistry through which it was found that they have a net negative charge and are stable between pH 3 and 10. Moreover, our initial toxicity tests showed that biochar colloids themselves are not toxic and they can be used in remediation applications, which led us to investigate (1) their copper sorption, a model inorganic contaminant, in a scenario that biochar colloids are released into the environment and (2) their potential use in organic pollutants adsorption and degradation. Copper sorption studies showed that biochar colloids have a copper sorption capacity as high as 22 mg $$\hbox {g}^{-1}$$in sub-ppm copper solutions. This increased the acute 48 h lethal concentration ($$\hbox {LC}_{50}$$) of copper for Daphnia magna by 21 ppb, which is comparable to the previously reported effect by dissolved organic matter. Adsorption and degradation of methylene blue (MB), an often-used proxy for organic contaminants in water, were studied by coupling the biochar colloids to positively charged $$\hbox {TiO}_{2}$$nanoparticles and using it as a photocatalyst. The hybrid MB photodegradation efficiency was $$21\%$$higher than that of $$\hbox {TiO}_{2}$$nanoparticles alone. Enhancement of demethylation is proposed as the main degradation mechanism of MB, as confirmed by liquid chromatography–mass spectroscopy (LC/MS), and the positive impact of biochar colloids is ascribed to their abundant adsorption sites, which may facilitate MB adsorption and its photocatalytic degradation.

AB  - In paddy fields, the opposing transformation of arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) poses many challenges for their simultaneous remediation. In our previous study, we reported that combined biochar and zero-valent iron (ZVI) amendment had great potential for the simultaneous alleviation of As and Cd bioavailability in contaminated acid paddy soil. In this study, an As- and Cd-contaminated alkaline paddy soil was further studied, and the same ZVI–biochar mixtures amendments were applied to evaluate the impact of the mixtures on As and Cd transformation and translocation in the soil–rice system by performing pot experiments with rice. In line with our previous study, the ZVI–biochar composites significantly reduced As and Cd accumulation in different rice tissues, leading to a 42% and 47% decrease in rice grain As and Cd levels, respectively, compared with the control values. The ZVI–biochar mixtures exhibited synergistic effects of biochar and ZVI by enhancing the transformation of bioavailable As and Cd fractions into less bioavailable fractions, and by increasing iron plaque formation to reduce As and Cd bioavailability. Although the bioaccumulation and translocation factors of As and Cd in alkaline paddy soil were generally lower than those in acid paddy soil, particularly in the presence of the ZVI–biochar mixtures, the grain As and Cd levels did not achieve the desired food safety standard levels, probably related to the high soil As content and the small changes in soil pH. Nevertheless, for treating lightly and moderately contaminated paddy soils, ZVI–biochar mixtures can still be a good choice in the future.

AB  - Soil β-glucosidase (BG), the rate-limiting enzyme in the final step of cellulose hydrolysis, plays a key role in microbial metabolism, carbon (C) cycling and sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems. Biochar application is known to affect soil BG activity; however, most of the biochar studies have focused on the potential activity of BG, and it is not clear how biochar influences the kinetic and thermodynamic behavior of BG in the soil. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of maize residue biochar on soil BG kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. Soil BG kinetic (Vmax and Km) and thermodynamic (Ea, ΔHa and Q10) parameters were determined within soils (clayey and sandy loam soils) amended with either maize residue (as positive control) or its biochar (600 °C) at 0.5 and 1.0% ratios (w/w), and the mixtures were incubated for 90 days. BG showed an increase in potential enzymatic activity (81%), enzyme concentration (higher Vmax value) (25%) and substrate affinity (lower Km value) (32%) in the biochar-amended sandy loam soil only at high addition rates compared with the control, and an increase by about 86% of the catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km). In the clayey soil, biochar addition decreased potential BG activity (by 10–29%), increased the Vmax value (by 20–25%) and had no impact on enzyme–substrate binding affinity, but still increased the catalytic efficiency by 47–72%. Adsorption of soil BG by biochar particles did not affect the catalytic efficiency in the soil. Generally, application of maize residue biochar to the soil decreased the Ea, ΔHa and Q10 values of BG compared with the negative controls at both biochar rates in the light-textured soil and only at low biochar rate in heavy-textured soil. The direction and magnitude of BG responses (activity, kinetics, and thermodynamics) to biochar were more related to the soil characteristics. Biochar would increase soil BG thermal stability and decrease its sensitivity to increasing temperature and global warming.

VL  - 1

AB  - Field studies were conducted over 2 years to determine the response of soil microbial biomass pool to biochar and N fertilizer combinations in a rain-fed rice cropping system. Biochar was applied at four doses: 0 t ha−1, 3 t ha−1, 6 t ha−1 and 12 t ha−1 in combination with N fertilizer at four rates: 0 kg ha−1, 30 kg ha−1, 60 kg ha−1 and 90 kg ha−1 to a Typic Paleustalf Alfisol. Soil samples from two depths (0–10 and 10–20 cm) were collected to determine microbial biomass C (MBC), N (MBN), P (MBP), MBC/N ratio, MBC/P ratio, soil CO2 flux, microbial qCO2, cultivable bacterial and fungal abundance. Biochar and N fertilizer combination effects on MBC, MBN and MBP pools were dependent on biochar doses, N fertilizer rates and soil depth. MBC/N and MBC/P ratios were decreased after 2 years. Soil CO2 flux was maximum at post-seeding stage of rice plant, while decreasing trends occurred at active tillering and harvest stage. Increasing doses of biochar irrespective of its combination with N fertilizer rates decreased CO2 flux and microbial qCO2. Combinations of biochar and N fertilizer increased fungal/bacterial ratio and induced a shift to a more fungal-dominated population after 2 years. Our results suggest that combination of biochar doses (3–12 t ha−1) with N fertilizer rates had stimulatory effects on microbial biomass pools and activity with positive implications for organic carbon accumulation, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) retention in tropical soils.

AB  - Despite an abundance of short-term studies focusing on biochar’s effects on annual plants, the long-term effects of biochar on perennial plants and the effects of the biochar on the mobility and speciation changes of metals/metalloids not limited to main plant nutrients in soils are poorly constrained. This study reports on the amelioration a sloped orthic ferralsol by biochar from Tibouchina wood and the resulting effects on perennial crops and microbiota, including a comprehensive analysis of metals/metalloids speciation changes. Fields were amended with biochar and urine-amended biochar (2 kg/m2) and were planted with papaya, banana, and manioc. Soil and plant materials were analyzed using acid digestions, sequential extractions, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Biochar applications led to decreased soil acidity, shifted the cation exchange capacity from being Al-influenced to being Mg/K/Ca-dominated, and elevated the concentrations of Mg, K, Ca, Zn, and Ba in soils. The exchangeable/acid-soluble fraction of Ca, P, and S notably increased. The soil microbial biome became more species rich and diverse in the biochar-amended fields. Manioc benefited from biochar applications, demonstrating increased growth, which resulted in generally decreased concentrations of trace elements in most plant parts, however, with an increased total elemental uptake. Urine amendment contributed to higher concentrations of P, S, and K in soils, but did not further increase plant growth. Biochar was shown to be a promising soil amendment for agricultural use of orthic ferralsols of the Brazil’s Atlantic forest region, but the accumulation of potentially harmful metals needs to be considered.

AB  - Biochar produced from straw has been shown to improve soil physicochemical properties. This review introduces the fundamental concepts, the broad applications, and underlying theory of straw biochar returning. Current developments in biochar industry and the production practices prevalent among enterprises in China are critiques. This review analyzes current knowledge gaps, challenges, and opportunities in the industrial application of straw biochar returning. Biochar standards, the quantitative and qualitative analysis methods for biochar, and high-value-added products that are based on biochar are critically examined with goal of providing recommendations for future studies. We propose production and modification of biochar that is application oriented to enhance its fitness for purpose as well as long-term and large-space–scale field study to better understand its impact on soil properties and ecotoxicology. Finally, we make prospects for the future development of SBR, including constructing a standard system about straw biochar returning and promoting self-discipline of biochar industry and the establishment of a biochar-based agricultural production model.

VL  - 1
IS  - 3
AB  - Pyrolysis is an option for enhancing the sustainable management of broiler manure surpluses by producing a concentrated, hygienic char product with a fertilizer and soil conditioner value. In this study, the impacts of pyrolysis conducted at 350, 400 and 450 °C on total nutrient and harmful element concentrations in biochars derived from peat-bedded broiler manure were examined. Emphasis was placed on the availability of phosphorus (P). In addition, the pore structures of these biochars were explored using X-ray microtomography and image analysis. During pyrolysis, 35–50%, 40–55% and 35–45% of the original carbon, nitrogen and sulfur contents, respectively, of the feedstock biomass were lost as volatiles. Mineral elements, including P, were concentrated in the biochar. Although water-extractable P was found to be converted to less labile forms due to charring, the concentration effect and notable increase in sodium bicarbonate-extractable P rendered broiler manure biochars richer in total labile P in comparison with feedstock manure (7.1, 10.0, 11.1 and 14.8 g labile P kg−1 in feedstock and biochars produced at 350, 400 and 450 °C, respectively). The pore volume of the micrometer-scale porosity of the broiler manure biochar was comparable to that found earlier in wood-based biochars. In comparison with wood-based biochars, the pore structure of broiler manure biochars was more versatile, and the pore size distribution was wider. Consequently, part of the porosity was too large to store plant-available water, which may reduce the potential of broiler manure biochars to improve soil water storage capacity.

SP  - 249

VL  - 1
IS  - 3
AB  - Biochar has been touted as a long-term carbon sequestration tool. However, there are no studies evaluating biochar’s effect on oxygen (O2) consumption as a measure of the microbial respiration response to biochar. To gain insight into this aspect, we evaluated O2 consumption rates to test the hypothesis that biochar is an efficient agent for carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration in soils. Four different biochar types and one activated charcoal were incubated alone and associated with three different soils for approximately 2 months in laboratory incubations. Headspace concentration of CO2 and O2 was periodically quantified. The data presented here confirm that the CO2 production following biochar’s addition to soils results in a process that is correlated to oxygen consumption. However, this overall stimulation is not clearly related to biochar type. Activated carbon resulted in the highest statistically significant stimulation of activity, despite it possessing the lowest quantity of volatile carbon and mineral nutrient sources. Taking into consideration our results, we conclude that using biochar does achieve total carbon sequestration. However, the amount of available soil organic carbon following soil incorporation appears to be reduced following biochar addition and its long-term implication on this mineralizable soil organic carbon pool does deserve more research attention.

AB  - The forms of phosphorus (P) in animal manure and peat are different from synthetic P fertilizers and will affect soil P fractions when they are used as P amendments. Effects of chicken manure (CMB) and peat (PB) derived biochars (CMB and PB) alone or in combination with P fertilizer (KH2PO4) and rock phosphate (RP) on plant/soil health and soil P fractions in an acidic ultisol were examined with greenhouse pot experiments. The total P rate was constant at 120 mg kg−1 in all treatments. Soil P fractions, P uptake, and maize growth were determined after 56 days. Application of CMB combined with P fertilizer or alone significantly increased soil pH, water extractable and relatively labile P, dry matter yield of maize, chlorophyll contents in maize leaves, while decreasing the Fe and Al binding P. Moreover, sole application of CMB and PB showed greater effects than application of P fertilizer alone regarding plant growth and P fractionation. Integration of synthetic inorganic P sources with CMB or sole application of CMB is more beneficial than application of inorganic P sources to improve plant growth and P availability.

AB  - Biochar is considered as a good metal sequester and ameliorates the metal toxicity and uptake in plants. However, its effectiveness over other organic amendments is not well discussed. The aim of this study is to compare the biochar amendments alleviating the levels of Pb and Cd in Withania somnifera L. Dunal with other organic manure. Farmyard manure, vermicompost, and biochar were applied in the field spiked with highly available Pb and Cd. Metal bioavailability and accumulation, plant growth and plant physiology, antioxidant enzymes and metabolite content of W. somnifera along with soil properties were evaluated in all treatments. Study indicates that the application of organic manures significantly alleviated the metal levels (33–72%) in the plant in comparison with control. The herbage yield was significantly higher (33–69%) under different organic manures as compared to the metal treatments. Secondary metabolite contents and antioxidant enzymes were higher in metal treatments in comparison with control. Organic manures were not only able to restrain the Pb and Cd in soil but also enhanced the soil microbial activities. Results indicate that biochar amendments were more promising than farmyard manure and vermicompost due to the presence of more stable carbon in biochar and more alleviation in metal uptake. In addition, net profit in the cultivation of W. somnifera was higher for biochar amendments (50% higher) compared to control. The study recommended that biochar could be a better option for commercial and safer production of W. somnifera.

AB  - Biochar is known to ameliorate soil fertility and increase crop yield; however, information regarding its effects on soil chemical and biological properties remains limited. The experiment was conducted to study the short-term impacts of different types of biochar on soil C fractions, enzyme activities, and microbial community structure at depositional and eroded landscape positions at different sampling times [before planting, after planting, and after harvesting of soybean (Glycine max L.)]. Three biochar materials, produced from C-optimized gasification of corn (maize, Zea mays L.) stover (CS), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson and C. Lawson) wood residue (PW), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) (SG), and dairy manure (DM) and mixture of dairy manure and pinewood biochar (DMP), were applied at a rate of 10 Mg ha−1 to depositional and eroded landscape positions. Data showed that the application of DMP and sole application of DM treatments significantly increased the labile C fractions at the depositional and eroded landscapes. The addition of DM and DMP increased the activities of β-glucosidase and urease enzymes, and those are involved in C and nitrogen cycling at depositional and eroded landscape positions. There were no significant differences between different biochar materials. However, there was an increase in soil microbial community structure in the DM and DMP treatments at both the landscape positions. In conclusion, our study revealed that DMP and sole application of DM influenced the soil labile C pool, enzyme activities, and microbial community structure at both the landscape positions for different sampling times.

AB  - How weathering affects the physiochemical properties of biochar and its long-term carbon (C) sequestration potential remains unclear. In this study, we measured changes in biochar recalcitrance and solubility after 7 years of weathering in a cultivated field. Biochar recalcitrance and biodegradability of weathered and unweathered hardwood biochar mixtures were determined by thermal analysis (differential scanning calorimetry) and evolved gas analysis. Differences in biochar solubility and the chemical composition of biochar-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were determined by repeated laboratory leaching and UV–Vis spectroscopy. The surface carbon-oxidation state (Cox) of biochar increased by 117.6–158.2% with weathering in the field, and there was an average of 0.9–1.2% decrease in biochar C contents per year. However, thermal indices of biochar recalcitrance and biodegradability, which suggested intermediate C sequestration potential, were not significantly different between weathered and unweathered biochars. The O:C ratio increased with weathering suggesting an increase in biodegradability, however, both weathered and unweathered biochars were still estimated to have half-lives of over 1000 years. Water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) concentrations from the unweathered biochar rapidly decreased during laboratory leaching to levels similar to the field-weathered biochars, and aromaticity (SUVA254) of WSOC increased from 5.9% in the unweathered biochar to 42% aromaticity in the biochars weathered for 7 years. We conclude that during short-term (years) weathering under field conditions, there is continued solubilization of increasingly aromatic biochar-C compounds, however, this accounts for a relatively small proportion of biochar C such that there is little-to-no change in biochar stability or C sequestration potential after field application.

AB  - The addition of biochar to sand columns can enhance the retention of bacteria and thus may provide a management strategy for removing bacteria from tile-drainage waters. In this study, the role of sand size as a factor in controlling microbial retention in biochar-amended sand columns was investigated. Laboratory column experiments were conducted to quantify the removal of two bacterial isolates (E. coli and Salmonella) and polystyrene microspheres in 10-cm-long columns packed with clean sand of three different sizes (0.25, 0.71, and 1.19 mm) at four biochar concentrations (0%, 5%, 10%, and 15%). Sorption studies were also performed to help identify the relative roles of sorption and physical straining on the removal of bacteria and microspheres within the columns. For the large sand, the log10 removal values (LRV) for E. coli increased from 0.22 to 0.49 for the 0% and 15% biochar concentrations, respectively, while LRV for Salmonella increased from 0.19 to 0.68. For the small sand, increasing biochar concentration from 0% to 15% increased LRV from 0.11 to 1.9 for E. coli and from 0.20 to 4.6 for Salmonella. In comparison, LRV for microspheres in the 15% biochar columns was only minimally higher than the unamended columns for all three sand sizes. Results from the sorption studies show that high sorption coefficients generally correlated with high LRV indicating that sorption rather than physical straining was the primary mechanism of retention in the columns. Results from this study further our understanding of bacterial retention in biochar-amended porous media.

AB  - Feedstock sources and pyrolysis temperatures affect the physicochemical and morphological properties of biochars. We evaluated biochars derived from switchgrass (SGB) and poultry litter (PLB) pyrolyzed at 350 °C (SGB350, PLB350) and 700 °C (SGB700, PLB700) to identify their potential ability in improving soil health. Except for SGB350, the pH of biochars was high (> 10.0) and can be used as an amendment in acid soils. PLB700 had higher mineral content and nutrient availability due to its higher ash content (tenfold higher) and electrical conductivity. Surface functional groups responsible for metal retention were evidenced in all biochars. Cation exchange capacity (CEC), specific surface area (SSA), and microporosity more than doubled by increasing pyrolysis temperature from 350 to 700 °C. The pH-buffering capacity measured through acid titration curve was better than that calculated with acid/alkali additions. Biochars pyrolyzed at 700 °C have much higher pH, CEC, SSA, and stronger buffering capacity, and thus are more promising to improve soil health and reduce contaminant bioavailability.

VL  - 1
IS  - 4
AB  - In recent years, due to the broad application of biochars, the preparation, environmental behavior and aging processes of biochars have attracted wide attention globally, especially the modification of biochars. However, most of the studies only consider the improvement of biochar properties right after the modification, but neglect a complete evaluation of the long-term stability and eco-toxicity of these newly developed materials after entering the environment. With the development and utilization of biochars, engineered biochars (EngBCs) will soon enter the market, but its environmental risk still remains unclear. The literature does not provide adequate information on how aging of EngBCs will affect their properties, and indirectly impact the properties of soils (cycle of elements and organic matter). Therefore, this review paper summarizes the aging process and environmental risk of biochars, aiming at better understanding the interactions between EngBCs and soil components or pollutants. More importantly, this review is to point out the contradictory speculations of environmental behavior of EngBCs studied at the present stage. Due to the modification, the EngBCs stability may be significantly reduced. However, the formation of functional group on EngBCs will enhance their interaction with soil minerals to form biochars–mineral complex, and thus EngBCs could be protected. The impacts of EngBCs after entering the environment are also ambiguous. Therefore, understanding EngBCs environmental behavior is critical, which is helpful to reduce the potential risk and to produce EngBCs following the rule of sustainable development and safety to the environment.

TI  - Biochar produced from Amazonian agro-industrial wastes: properties and adsorbent potential of Cd2+ and Cu2+
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 389
EP  - 400
VL  - 1
IS  - 4
AB  - In the Amazon region, several residues that have been misused can serve as feedstocks for biochar production with the aim of recovering soils contaminated by heavy metals. However, these biochars need to be firstly tested for their adsorption capacity as well as their physicochemical attributes prior to field application. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize and evaluate the adsorption capacities of Cd2+ and Cu2+ of biochars produced from acai (BA), Brazil nut (BN), and palm kernel cake (BK) residues. Biochars were produced by slow pyrolysis at four different temperatures (400, 500, 600, and 700 °C). The physicochemical properties of the biochars, such as cation exchange capacity, ash, recalcitrance index, and aromaticity were enhanced with increased pyrolysis temperature. The adsorption capacities of Cd2+ and Cu2+ showed high correlations with the physicochemical properties of biochar, indicating the importance of these characteristics in the adsorption process. Furthermore, the adsorption of Cd2+ and Cu2+ also increased with the increase in the pyrolysis temperature. In a competitive system, Cd2+ exhibited higher adsorption capacity than Cu2+ for all biochars. In general, BN showed the highest adsorption capacity, followed by BK and BA. Biochars produced from the Amazonian residues have the potential to improve soil quality when used as amendments in the recovery of soils contaminated with Cd and Cu, representing an environmentally sound technology for the reuse of these residues.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 375
EP  - 388
VL  - 1
IS  - 4
AB  - The individual and combined effects of biochar (B) and inorganic fertiliser (F) have all been widely proofed to improve soil fertility and enhance crop growth and yield under irrigation (I) and rain fed conditions. However, the strength of their individual and combined effects on crop productivity has been scarcely reported. In addition, few studies have assessed their individual and co-application effects on economic returns. Therefore, a 2-year field experiment which consisted of factorial combination of irrigation (I) [100% full irrigation (FI), 80% FI and 60% FI], biochar (0 and 20 t/ha) and fertiliser (0 and 300 kg/ha) was conducted. According to the results, irrigation was the dominant factor that influences maize grain yield, followed by inorganic fertiliser and biochar, and they were all significant in their main effects. The strength of interaction effects among, I, F and B on maize grain yield follow the sequence F × I > B × F > B × I. The economic analysis showed that the ternary combination of B, F and I was more economical than the binary combination of B plus I, and F plus I (in that order), when compared with the standalone application of I at maximum production in the field experiment. In addition, combined applications of biochar and fertiliser improved soil nutrients, nutrient uptake in all irrigation treatments, compared to the standalone applications of biochar or fertiliser. Further research is, therefore, recommended for long-term evaluation of the economic viability of integrating biochar with fertiliser under irrigation.

VL  - 1
IS  - 4
AB  - One-pot chemical activation and pyrolysis process was developed for biochar production from red macroalgae residue of Gelidium sesquipedale. The macroalgae residue was activated by various catalysts (KOH, NaOH, H3PO4, and CH4ON2) with the two concentrations (2.5 wt% and 5 wt%) using a pulverization system followed by slow pyrolysis at 500 °C. The activated biochars showed a porous morphology with an increase of water holding capacity compared to the unactivated one. The properties of activated biochar observed by further characterization (i.e., FTIR, SEM, TGA) revealed their feasibility to be used as an adsorbent. The results of adsorption experiment confirmed that adsorption was dependent not only on the surface area but also on the surface charge, and functional groups. The sorption performance of activated biochars (AcBC), in terms of the adsorption of methylene blue, was comparable to commercial activated charcoal (Norit®). NaOH (2.5 wt%)-activated biochar had the removal efficiency of 87% versus 97% for commercial activated charcoal.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 365

VL  - 1
IS  - 4
AB  - The addition of biochar, sodium silicate, or earthworm is a feasible practice to repair soils disturbed by mining activities, and the reclamation is largely based on the alteration of the diversity and structure of soil bacteria. The objectives of this study were to assess the relative importance of these supplements on soil bacterial community diversity and structure in reclaimed mine areas. A field experiment with soybean was carried out in mining areas to assess the efficiency of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) fertilizers plus those supplements on soil bacterial community structure and diversity by the 16S rRNA sequencing method. Soil chemical properties were analyzed to their effects on the bacterial community structure. The results showed that the application of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) fertilizers significantly increased bacterial diversity, and a further increase was observed in NPK plus biochar, sodium silicate or earthworm addition. Furthermore, a higher number of genera were found in the NPK plus biochar and NPK plus earthworm treatments than that in the control, NPK and NPK plus sodium silicate treatments. The bacterial community was significantly associated with nutrients, such as carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). Moreover, soil organic carbon (SOC) and pH were the most dominant factors in shaping the soil bacterial community structure and diversity. Our data indicate that the addition of earthworms to soil rather than biochar and sodium silicate was the best strategy to mitigate the detrimental effects of mining activities on soil bacterial diversity.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 121

VL  - 2
IS  - 1
AB  - Various materials have been extensively investigated to mimic the structures and functions of natural enzymes. We describe the discovery of a new catalytic property in the group of biochar-based carbonaceous materials, which are usually produced during biowaste thermal processing under specific conditions. The tested biochars exhibited peroxidase-like catalytic activity. Biomaterial feedstock, pyrolysis temperature, size of resulting biochar particles or biochar modification (e.g., magnetic particles deposition) influenced the peroxidase-like activity. Catalytic activity was measured with the chromogenic organic substrates N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) or 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Magnetic biochar composite was studied as a complementary material, in which the presence of iron oxide particles enhances catalytic activity and enables smart magnetic separation of catalyst even from complex mixtures. The activity of the selected biochar had an optimum at pH 4 and temperature 32 °C; biochar catalyst can be reused ten times without the loss of activity. Using DPD as a substrate, Km values for native wood chip biochar and its magnetic derivative were 220 ± 5 μmol L−1 and 690 ± 80 μmol L−1, respectively, while Vmax values were 10.1 ± 0.3 μmol L−1 min−1 and 16.1 ± 0.4 μmol L−1 min−1, respectively. Biochar catalytic activity enabled the decolorization of crystal violet both in the model solution and the fish pond water containing suspended solids and dissolved organic matter. The observed biochar enzyme mimetic activity can thus find interesting applications in environmental technology for the degradation of selected xenobiotics. In general, this property predestines the low-cost biochar to be a perspective supplement or even substitution of common peroxidases in practical applications.

TI  - Potential of biochar and organic amendments for reclamation of coastal acidic-salt affected soil

SP  - 107

VL  - 2
IS  - 1
AB  - Salinity and acidity have affected several hundred million hectares of land throughout the globe which poses a major threat to global food security and biodiversity. Application of organic amendments for salt-affected soils has been identified as one of the most effective ways to mitigate salinity-induced problems and considered as a green technique offering twin benefits of waste load reduction and land reclamation. However, studies on reclaiming acidic-salt affected soils are limited. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the reclamation potential of biochars and organic amendments involving Gliricidia sepium biochar produced at 300 °C, 500 °C, and 700 °C, green waste compost, and municipal sewage sludge at three different amendment ratios, 1.0%, 2.5% and 5.0%. The incubation experiment was conducted for a 4-month period with different amendment ratios applied to the coastal acidic-salt affected soil. Subsamples were extracted from incubation pots after 1 and 4 months and analyzed for soil chemical parameters (pH, EC, NO3−, PO43−, total organic carbon, cation exchange capacity, sodium adsorption ratio, exchangeable sodium percentage) and microbial enzyme activity (catalase activity, and acid- and alkaline phosphatase activity). All organic amendments demonstrated enhancement of the soil properties in a significant manner. However, increasing incubation time and amendment ratio increase the changes of soil parameters by a great percentage. Therefore, the maximum amendment ratio of 5.0% and 4 months of incubation period rendered a significant improvement in the reclamation of acidic-salt affected soil. However, the biochar produced at 500 °C contributed the maximum towards the improved physicochemical and biochemical profile of acidic-salt affected soil, making it the most promising organic amendment for the reclamation of acidic-salt affected soil. The overall reclamation efficiency of organic amendments registered the following order of variation: 700 BC < Sludge < 300 BC < Compost < 500 BC.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 93
EP  - 105
VL  - 2
IS  - 1
AB  - Meta-analyses have shown that only about half of biochar addition studies report improved plant growth. To improve yield response, here we describe a decision support tool (DST) for selecting a biochar type and amendment rate to meet soil and crop management goals, based on soil and biochar tests values and crop requirements as reported by regional extension recommendations. Using data from a greenhouse wheat trial, we assessed whether this approach could predict changes in soil chemistry and whether it could identify soils in which amendment would stimulate crop yield. These data indicated that the DST could provide semi-quantitative predictions of biochar amendment rates needed to meet target soil pH levels, with recommended rates averaging 25% higher than were needed. The DST was better at predicting biochar application rates to provision P and K. Across six soil types, post-harvest measurements of extractable-K showed an average 104% recovery of the quantities estimated to be provisioned by conifer wood or wheat straw biochars. Extractable-P recovery averaged 101% in two sandy soils with low P-retention but was considerably lower in four soils with higher P-retention capacity. Greenhouse data also showed that wheat growth improved only when biochar alleviated pH that was substantially below critical thresholds for plant growth, and supported the principle of using crop-specific pH requirements as part of an approach for biochar decision-support. Future field trials that evaluate yield responses in several nutrient-deficient or acidified soils will be needed to provide a robust evaluation of this DST.

VL  - 2
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar application to soil has been proposed as a potential management strategy to enhance soil carbon (C) sequestration, reduce greenhouse gas emission, improve soil quality, and increase crop productivity. The effects of biochar on soil microbial and enzyme activities are integrally linked to the potential of biochar in achieving these benefits. We conducted a global meta-analysis to assess the effects of biochar on soil microbial biomass C and nitrogen (N) and the activities of 12 enzymes, and identify key factors affecting those soil microbial properties using 964 data points from 72 papers. We found that biochar effects on enzyme activities vary widely with soil type, biochar property and the type of enzyme studied. Biochar significantly increased microbial biomass C (MBC) and urease, alkaline phosphatase and dehydrogenase activities by 21.7%, 23.1%, 25.4% and 19.8%, respectively, with no significant negative effects on any of the enzymes analyzed in this study. Biochar application was more effective in increasing MBC and enzyme activities in soils with low pH (< 6.5), TC (< 20 g kg−1), TN (< 2 g kg−1), and a fine texture (including clay, clay loam and silt clay). Biochars produced at pyrolysis temperature of 350–550 °C with a high pH (> 10) and low C/N ratio (< 50) increased MBC and urease and dehydrogenase activities. Biochar increased MBC and N-acquisition enzyme activities in the field but not in lab incubation experiments. Urease was increased in short-term studies (within 100 days of biochar application) while alkaline phosphatase was increased in long-term studies that span more than 1 year. The increase in MBC and activities of some soil enzymes in response to biochar application with no negative effects on any hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes illustrate its potential to enhance soil quality particularly in the degraded soils with low nutrient availability and fertility due to limited soil microbial and enzymatic activities. This study also shows that biochars can be designed to achieve specific properties for enhancing microbial and enzymatic activities for specific soils.

AB  - A novel α-FeOOH modified wheat straw biochar (α-FeOOH@BC) was developed and the findings of the current study showed that α-FeOOH@BC is an efficient material for the simultaneous removal of cations (Cd(II)) and anions (As(III)) from aqueous solutions. The SEM, FTIR, and XRD analysis proved that α-FeOOH@BC was covered by α-FeOOH. In the single adsorption system, the maximum adsorption capacities of α-FeOOH@BC for Cd(II) and As(III) were 62.9 and 78.3 mg/g, respectively. In the dual adsorption system, the maximum adsorption capacities of α-FeOOH@BC for Cd(II) and As(III) dropped to 39.3 and 67.2 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption capacities of Cd(II) and As(III) by α-FeOOH@BC were much higher by BC and α-FeOOH both in single and dual adsorbate system. The adsorption results were well fitted by the Langmuir and pseudo-second-order kinetics models. The Cd(II) and As(III) co-adsorption on α-FeOOH@BC had a competitive effect, and the dominant adsorption mechanisms were co-precipitation and ion exchange. Our study showed that α-FeOOH@BC could be an effective remediation material for Cd(II) and As(III) co-adsorption from aqueous environment.

AB  - The development of biochar has triggered a hot-spot in various research fields including agriculture, energy, environment, and materials. Biochar-based materials provide a novel approach against environmental challenging issues. Considering the rapid development of biochar materials, this review serves as a valuable platform to summarize the recent progress on the theoretical investigation and engineering applications of biochar materials in environmental remediation. For a better understanding of the structure–application relationships, the structural properties of biochar from macroscopic and microscopic aspects are summarized. The multilevel structures including elements, phases, surface chemistry, and molecular are highlighted to elucidate the multi-functional properties of biochars. Sorption, catalysis, redox reaction, and biological activity of biochar are briefly illustrated, which influence the transport, transformation, and removal of organic and inorganic pollutants in the environments. According to the multi-level structures and structure–application relationships of biochar, specific biochar-based materials and devices have been designed for practical environmental application. The important progress on the functionalization and device of biochar-based materials, including magnetic biochars, 2D and 3D biochar-based macrostructures, immobilized microorganism on biochar, and biochar-amended biofilters are highlighted. The environmental friendliness and sustainability of biochar-based materials, considering the whole cycle from synthesis to application, are evaluated.

AB  - Thallium (Tl) is an extremely harmful metal that is substantially distributed in the environment. It can threaten human health via consumption of food potentially derived from Tl-contaminated agricultural production. Little information is available on how to utilize biochar to remediate Tl contamination in agricultural soils. More efforts are urgently needed to be devoted to developing effective techniques to empower biochar with high selectivity of Tl in agricultural soils. In this review, we provided comprehensive information on Tl contamination in agricultural soils. We also discussed recent developments and assessed the current status of biochar applications. We briefly reviewed the bridge between biochar preparation technology and utilization wherein further developments can exhibit potential in terms of Tl remediation. Hence, biochar is expected to exhibit excellent Tl remediation performance in contaminated agricultural soils with promising application prospects. The obtained knowledge provides further insights into the remediation of Tl contamination in agricultural soils.

IS  - 2
AB  - Lignin-rich recalcitrant biomass residues of coconut palms viz. (i) mature coconut husk, (ii) tender (immature or green) coconut husk (iii) coconut leaf petiole and (iv) coir-pith were successfully pyrolysed using a simple charring kiln into carbon-rich, black, light weight and porous biochars. High alkalinity and good ash content made them fit for remediating acid soils. High potassium content in these biochars could help reduce the use of inorganic K. Thermogravimetric analysis showed the mass loss phases of husk and coconut leaf petiole biochars to be similar. However, all four biochars gave smooth curves indicating thermal stability of the product. Positive seed germination and earthworm avoidance tests proved their potential as soil amendment. Soil incubation studies with coconut biochars in graded doses, alone or in combination with coconut leaf vermicompost, increased the pH, organic carbon and potassium contents, and promoted plant-beneficial microbiota and enzyme activities. Pot studies with tender coconut husk biochar and coconut leaf vermicompost enhanced the dry weight of cowpea plants accompanied with increased arbuscular mycorrhizal sporulation and root colonization, and root nodule dry weight. A field trial resulted in higher chilli yields with tender coconut husk biochar + coconut leaf vermicompost addition. The results from our studies highlight the potential of pyrolysis as an innovative technology for quick recycling of highly recalcitrant coconut palm biomass residues to biochars as a local source of soil amendment to aid regenerative agriculture in humid tropics.

In this review, the application of biochar and biochar-based materials for the efficient elimination of organic and inorganic pollutants are summarized. The sorption of organic chemicals and heavy metal ions/radionuclides, degradation/transformation of organic pollutants, and sorption–reduction–solidification of high-valent metal ions are described in detail. The interaction mechanism at molecular level from advanced spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations is discussed. Finally, the challenges in the application of biochar and biochar-supported materials in the immobilization of heavy metal ions and photocatalytic degradation of persistent organic pollutants in soils or wastewater are pointed out. This review is helpful for the graduate students to understand the recent works about biochar and biochar-supported materials in environmental pollutants management.

IS  - 2
AB  - Biochar is known for its effects on carbon sequestration and soil fertility. However, there is a lack of information about its effects on soil physical and hydraulic properties for tropical soils. We assessed the effects of biochar (BC) plus sugar cane filter cake (FC) rate, and time of interaction on soil physical and hydraulic properties under humid tropical conditions. For this purpose, a field experiment was installed at a loamy sandy soil with five treatments and four replicates: control (only soil), 25 Mg ha−1 sugar cane filter cake, and 25 Mg ha−1 sugar cane filter cake plus 6.25, 12.5, and 25 Mg ha−1Miscanthus biochar, respectively, two soil depths (0–10 and 10–20 cm) and two times of interaction (9 and 18 months). Physical properties (aggregate stability, bulk density, total porosity, pores size distribution) and hydraulic properties (soil water holding capacity, hydraulic conductivity, plant-available water holding capacity) were measured after nine and eighteen months. The bulk density decreased slightly, and the porosity increased after nine months, for the biochar plus sugar cane filter cake (both 25 Mg ha−1). After 18 months, biochar plus filter cake interaction increase micropores, aggregate stability, and plant-available water content. Saturated hydraulic conductivity was not influenced by sugar cane filter cake. However, biochar significantly reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity when combined with sugar cane filter cake after 18 months. We concluded that sugar cane filter cake in combination with biochar modified the pore size distribution, slightly increased plant-available water holding capacity, and significantly decreased saturated hydraulic conductivity.

AB  - Biomass is a green energy source and is available in abundance. Biochar is a carbon-rich material derived from a wide range of biomass or organic waste through the thermochemical route. Biochar has received increasing attention because of its distinctive properties such as high carbon content, greater specific surface area, cation exchange capacity, nutrient retention capacity, and stable structure. This review paper extensively studies and reports the different pyrolysis processes, reactor types, the effect of process parameters on biochar yield, and its physicochemical properties, biochar activation methods, and applications. It also details the status of the research and development (R&D) progress in biochar production through conventional and advanced technologies. The study found that unlike many products (at R&D stage) biochar has high potential to scale up and has a direct impact on crop yield, water purification (for domestic and industrial application), alternative fuels (clean solid fuel for cookstove), air purification, catalyst, biogas production, purification, and storage. In addition, the paper lists the merits and challenges in the novel biochar applications like hydrogen storage, electrochemical capacitor, and fuel cell technology.

SP  - 239
EP  - 251
VL  - 2
IS  - 2
AB  - Pennisetum purpureum is one of the most invasive perennial grasses of the Poaceae family, which are abundant in south-east Asia including Brunei Darussalam. The pyrolysis process at a slow heating rate proved to be highly promising for biochar production. The production and characterization of different Pennisetum purpureum biochars have been investigated at the pyrolysis temperatures of 400 °C, 500 °C and 600 °C with a heating and nitrogen flow rate of 5 °C/min and 0.5 L/min, respectively. The observed higher heating values were 22.18 MJ/kg, 23.02 MJ/kg, 23.75 MJ/kg, and the alkaline pH were 9.10, 9.86, 10.17 for the biochar at 400 °C, 500 °C, 600 °C temperatures, respectively. The water holding capacity was one hundred percent for all biochars and continued to increase for higher pyrolysis temperature. SEM images show that the porosity of the biochars has been enhanced with increased temperatures due to the rearrangement of crystallinity and aromaticity. On the other hand, the yields of biochar have been decreased from 35.13% to 23.02% for the increase of pyrolysis temperature from 400 °C to 600 °C. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis shows that the O/C atomic ratios were 0.15, 0.08 and 0.06 for the biochar of 400, 500 and 600 °C which validates the improvement in heating values. FT-IR analysis revealed that the available functional groups in the biochars were C–O, C=C, and C–H. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under pyrolysis condition showed residue of 46.56%, 51.13% and 55.67% from the biochar at 400, 500, and 600 °C, respectively. The derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) graph indicates that the degradation rate is higher for 400 °C biochar than the 600 °C biochar.

VL  - 2
IS  - 2
AB  - Forest management practices in boreal peatlands increase nutrient export and suspended solids to watercourses calling for development of new water protection methods. One potential solution could be adsorption-based purification of runoff water using biochar. The aim of this study was to determine the adsorption rate and capacity for Norway spruce and silver birch biochars to design a biochar-filled reactor for a ditch drain. In a 10-day laboratory experiment, biochar was stirred with runoff water from a clear-cut peatland forest, and changes in water pH, total nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, phosphorus, and total organic carbon concentrations were measured. Based on the concentration changes, adsorption was quantified and adsorption model containing the adsorption rate and capacity was fitted to the data. Our results indicate that biochar effectively adsorbs both inorganic and organic nitrogen from runoff water. Birch biochar had higher adsorption capacity of nitrogen than spruce biochar. This study demonstrates that the adsorption of nitrogen compounds onto biochar surfaces increases with increasing initial concentrations. Thus, aquatic ecosystems exposed to high nutrient loads from fertile peatlands would particularly benefit from biochar-based water purification.

VL  - 2
IS  - 3
AB  - Biochar has the potential to affect the cycle of phosphorus (P), but the underlying mechanisms of its effects remain poorly understood in calcareous soils. Our understanding of the effects of biochar is limited in calcareous soils during incubation. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate how the availability and mineral fractions of P change after the addition of combined biochar and P fertilizer during incubation in calcareous soil. Sugarcane residue (raw SR) and biochar (400 °C for 2 h) were added to soils treated with 50 mg kg−1 of P, in the form of Ca(H2PO4)2·H2O, at 0.5 and 1% (w/w). The soils were incubated at 25 ± 1 °C for 120 days. Available P (Olsen P) contents and mineral P fractions were measured after various incubation times (7, 30, 90, and 120 days). Biochar addition remarkably increased the amount of available P when compared with the raw SR treatment and the control condition (P < 0.05). After 30 days of incubation, the amount of available P in the soils decreased and remained unchanged thereafter. The results indicated that the addition of 50 mg kg−1 of P as fertilizer significantly augmented the labile P and P associated with Fe and Al in all the treatments at all incubation times (P < 0.05). In comparison with P treated with raw SR, P associated with Fe and Al was significantly enhanced after biochar addition (P < 0.05). Significant correlations were found for available P with labile P and P associated with Fe and Al. We found that biochar addition could increase available pools, thus improving available P concentrations at various incubation times. Therefore, we conclude that sugarcane residue biochar can enhance the available P in calcareous soils.

IS  - 2
AB  - Fe-impregnated biochar (Fe-BC) as high-efficiency heterogeneous Fenton catalyst was synthesized and evaluated in detail for its catalytic activity, stability and reusability under various conditions. The optimal conditions for the Fenton oxidation of methylene blue (MB) as model dye were determined as 0.075 g/L H2O2, 0.5 g/L Fe-BC for 0.1 g/L MB, which resulted in optimum Dye:Fecat:H2O2 ratio of 1:5:0.75 (on g/L basis) or [Dye]:[Fetotal]:[H2O2] molar ratio of 1:6.2:7.0 respectively. The effective degradation of MB was identified over a wider pH range, and even after four consecutive runs Fe-BC maintained above 95% MB removal rate within 3 min of treatment with low Fe release, indicating strong stability and reusability. Under the optimum Dye:Fecat:H2O2 (g/L) condition at initial pH 4, the Fe-BC achieved 99.9% removal efficiency of MB within 3 min in heterogeneous Fenton reaction (HEFR) with much less H2O2 concentration and low catalyst dosage, demonstrating its efficiency and cost-effectiveness compared to other Fenton reaction catalysts. The removal velocity of MB showed two rate steps: a fast first stage followed by a slow stage with the rate in the order of H2O2/Fe-BC ⋙ H2O2/biochar > biochar > H2O2. Overall, the developed Fe-BC is more economical with strong stability and recyclability for use in HEFR for treating recalcitrant pollutants.

VL  - 2
IS  - 3
AB  - The application of designer biochar has the potential to impact soil enzyme activity and soil nitrogen dynamics. However, very little is known about the mechanisms responsible for biochar-enzyme-nitrogen interaction in highly weathered soils. The objective of our 3-year (2016–2018) field experiment was to evaluate the effectiveness of designer biochars (DB) in enhancing urease activity (UA), total nitrogen (TN), total inorganic nitrogen (TIN), and nitrogen uptake (NU) at different growth stages (GS) of corn in a highly weathered soil of southeastern Coastal Plain region, USA. Experimental treatments have consisted of the control, 100% pine chips (100PC), 100% poultry litter (100PL), 2:1 blend of PC and PL (PCPL), 100% raw switchgrass (Panicum vaginatum, L; 100RSG), and 2:1 blend of PC and RSG (PCRSG). All the designer biochar treatments were applied at the rate of 30,000 kg ha−1 to a Goldsboro loamy sand in 2016. Urease activity, TN, TIN, and NU varied remarkably with DB (p ≤ 0.0001) at different GS (p ≤ 0.0001) of corn. Soils treated with 100PL had the greatest UA (28.18 µg N g−1 h−1), TN (0.087%), and TIN (14.53 mg kg−1) while the least UA, TN, and TIN of 20.55 µg N g−1 h−1, 0.063%, and 5.42 mg kg−1, respectively, were observed from the control. The three-year TN average increase over the control was in the order: 100PL (36.8%) > 100RSG (25.8%) > PCRSG (25.3%) > PCPL (23.9%) > 100PC (7.1%). The greatest NU of corn of 140.4 kg N ha−1 was from soils treated with 100PL while the least amount of NU was from 100PC. Overall, our results showed promising significance for the treatment of highly weathered soils since the application of DB did enhance UA and improve TN and TIN in the soils.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 151
EP  - 163
VL  - 2
IS  - 2
AB  - The sorption capacity and affinity of biochar for metals are both important attributes that determine biochar’s suitability as a soil amendment for contaminant mitigation, yet few analyses have considered both characteristics simultaneously. We present a systematic review of literature published between 2010 and 2018 to test the hypothesis that sorption capacity and affinity are affected by biochar properties, attributes of the metal contaminant, and experimental conditions, in that order. We used random forest (RF) and multi-objective optimization to analyze data of 559 individual Langmuir adsorption isotherms extracted from 133 studies covering the sorption capacity (Cmax) and affinity (KL) of biochar for 17 different metals, elaborated from six different feedstock classes, three different types of feedstock pretreatment, and five types of post-pyrolysis treatment. Highest sorption values were obtained for Pb(II), Cr(IV), and Cd(II). The feedstock used was the key determinant influencing biochar’s capacity and affinity to sorb metal contaminants (first and fourth most important variable in RF models for Cmax and KL, respectively) with best results obtained for biochar elaborated from nutrient-dense feedstocks (animal biowaste, sludge, and manure). Biochars that had both high sorption capacity and affinity were the result of a longer duration of pyrolysis; they had lower C and higher N and O content, as well as lower C/N and higher O/C and H/C ratios, higher pore volumes and higher pH. Applying some form of pretreatment was better than none, whereas chemical modification was the best of the post-treatment methods analyzed. This review demonstrates clearly that multiple parameters during the preparation process influence the effectiveness of biochar to immobilize metal contaminants. Future research that focuses on mechanisms and the underlying factors for the correlations observed should allow the development of biochar formulations that are even more effective at immobilizing metal contaminants in soils and sediments.

VL  - 2
IS  - 2
AB  - Hydrochar (HC), produced by hydrothermal carbonization, offers technical advantages over biochar (BC) produced by pyrolysis, and is suitable for soil amelioration, carbon sequestration, and enhanced plant growth. BC grain size has been shown to influence nutrient retention, microbial colonization and aggregate formation; however, similar research for HC is lacking. Pot trials were conducted to investigate the influence of HC grain size [coarse (6.3–2 mm), medium (2–0.63 mm) and fine (< 0.63 mm)], produced from biogas digestate, for soil improvement in three soils: loamy Chernozem, sandy Podzol, and clayey Gleysol, at a 5% HC application rate (w/w). All soils including two controls (with and without plants) were analysed for water holding capacity (WHC), cation exchange capacity (CEC), wet aggregate stability, pH, plant available nutrients (PO4–P, K and Nmin) and germination and biomass success using standard laboratory and statistical methods. Soil pH showed a compensatory shift toward the HC pH (7.2) in all soils over the course of the study. For example, the pH of the medium grained HC treatment for the Chernozem decreased from 7.9 to 7.2 and increased in the Podzol and Gleysol from 5.9 to 6.1 and 4.9 to 5.5, respectively. The nutrient-rich HC (2034 ± 38.3 mg kg−1 PO4–P and 2612.5 ± 268.7 mg kg−1 K content) provided only a short-term supply of nutrients, due to the relatively easily mineralized fraction of HC, which allowed for quick nutrient release. The pH and PO4–P effects were most pronounced in the fine grained HC treatments, with a ~ 87%, ~ 308% and ~ 2500% increase in PO4–P content in the Chernozem, Podzol and Gleysol, respectively, compared to the controls at the beginning of the study. The same trend was observed for the K and NH4+ content in the fine and medium grained HC treatments in all soils. No seed germination inhibition of Chinese cabbage was observed, with average germination rates > 50% in all soils. An effect on NO3− content was indeterminable, while there was little to no effect on biomass production, WHC, CEC and aggregate stability. In conclusion, the application of 5% fine grained HC significantly influenced the nutrient content over a short-term. However, the application rate was insufficient to substantially improve plant growth, nor to sustain a longer-term nutrients supply, regardless of grain size.

AB  - Biochar, derived from thermal pyrolysis of biomass, has been regarded as a low-cost, sustainable and beneficial material and widely applied in agriculture, environment and energy during the last two decades. To elucidate the research status timely and future trends in biochar field, CiteSpace is used to systematically analyze the related literature retrieved from the Web of Science core collection in 2019. Based on the keywords clustering analysis, it was found that “biochar production”, “organic pollutants removal”, “heavy metals immobilization”, “bioremediation” were the main hotspots in research covering biochar. “Bioremediation” is an emerging topic and deserves extensive attention due to its highly effective and environmentally friendly treatment of pollutants. Improving the phytoremediation effect, immobilizing functional microorganisms on biochar, and using microorganisms as raw materials to produce biochar were the common methods of biochar-assisted bioremediation. While studies focused on “soil quality and plant growth” and “biochar and global climate change” decreased, investigations concentrated in the toxicity of biochar to soil biota and ruminants are sustainably growing. Research on direct and catalytic thermal pyrolysis of green waste (mainly microalgae) for biofuels (bio-oil, biodiesel, syngas, etc.) and biochar production is increasing. Converting municipal wastes (e.g., sewage sludge, fallen leaves) into biochar through pyrolysis was a suitable treatment for municipal waste and became a popular topic in recent time. Moreover, the biochar produced from these municipal wastes exhibited excellent performance in the removal of pollutants from wastewater and soil. This review may help to identify future directions in biochar research and applications.

AB  - Biochar is traditionally used as solid fuel and for soil amendment where its electrical conductivity is largely irrelevant and unexplored. However, electrical conductivity is critical to biochar’s performance in new applications such as supercapacitor energy storage and capacitive deionization of water. In this study, sugar maple and white pine were carbonized via a slow pyrolysis process at 600, 800 and 1000 °C and conductivities of monolithic biochar samples along the radial direction were measured using the 4-probe method. Biochars were characterized using an elemental analyzer, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The solid carbon in biochar samples was found to consist primarily of disordered carbon atoms with small graphitic nanocrystallites that grow with increasing temperature. The bulk conductivity of biochar was found to increase with pyrolysis temperature—1 to ~ 1000 S/m for maple and 1 to ~ 350 S/m for pine, which was accompanied by an increase in carbon content—91 to 97 wt% and 90 to 96 wt% for maple and pine, respectively. The skeletal conductivity of biochar samples carbonized at 1000 °C is about 3300 S/m and 2300 S/m for maple and pine, respectively (assuming solid carbon is amorphous); both values are above that of amorphous carbon (1250–2000 S/m). This work demonstrated the importance of carbonization and graphitization to electrical conductivity and suggested electron hopping as a likely mechanism for electric conduction in biochar—an amorphous carbon matrix embedded with graphitic nanocrystallites.

AB  - Biochar amendment improves the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of different soil types under different climatic and environmental conditions. In this study, effects of biochar or live pasture plants existing alone or co-existing on selected soil properties of sandy loam soil under humid lowland tropical climatic conditions were investigated. The changes measured in the amended soil, with or without plants, were compared to the unamended and unplanted soils. Biochar amendment with or without pasture improved moisture retention, lowered bulk density, increased pH and kept the electrical conductivity within ranges conducive for pasture growth. Generally, contents of all the nutrients increased following biochar amendment, however pasture establishment without amendment resulted in depletion of available potassium and magnesium. Under all treatment conditions, soil organic carbon and soil organic matter were significantly depleted. Cogon grass is invasive under all land use systems and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions through slash-and-burn. Using biomass from the grass instead of burning would mitigate CO2 emissions from the tropics.

AB  - This study focuses on the synthesis of metal-based biochar catalysts and their catalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS, HSO5−) for the degradation of three different wastewater model pollutants employing advanced oxidation processes (AOP). Iron, copper, and two different cobalt-based catalysts were prepared and evaluated. The catalysts were supported on a biochar obtained from the pyrolysis of woody pruning wastes. They were characterized by C, H, and N elemental analysis, X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The metal content in each catalyst was determined by means of atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The degradation reactions of benzoic acid (BA), catechol (C), and cinnamic acid (CA) were carried out in a lab scale batch glass reactor and were followed by UV–Visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis). A colorimetric technique was employed to verify the presence of oxidant during the reaction progress. The catalyst/oxidant optimal ratio was determined for the cobalt catalysts. The mineralization degree of the pollutants after the degradations was verified by means of total organic carbon (TOC) content in the residual liquids. After 4 h of reaction, the maximum mineralization was reached when C was treated with a cobalt-based catalyst (> 80%), and its stability was evaluated through successive cycles of use.

AB  - There is little understanding as to whether the addition of biochar requires less fertilizer to obtain the potential yield. Furthermore, the additional yield ascribed to the non-nutrient effects of biochar is ambiguously quantified. Therefore, this study is aimed to elucidate the influence of biochar application rate and production temperature on (i) marginal agronomic efficiency (AELN), (ii) potential yield (Yopt), (iii) the amount of mineral fertilizer required to obtain the potential yield (Fopt); and (iv) nutrient use efficiency. AELN, Yopt and Fopt were calculated after fitting the yield response at different levels of mineral fertilizer with a second-degree polynomial. Application of biochar reduced marginal agronomic efficiency, implying that the plant utilized the applied nutrient more efficiently without biochar at a low dose of mineral fertilizer. Biochar increased potential yield but required more mineral fertilizer to obtain the optimum yield. The non-nutrient associated effect of biochar reached to 39% and is mainly attributed to its liming effect. The effect of biochar on AELN, Yopt, Fopt, fertilizer use efficiency and soil pH were more pronounced at the higher application rate. Addition of biochar, however, increased soil Mehlich-P and carbon content, irrespective of production temperature and application rate. This study demonstrated that the short-term effect of biochar application on fertilizer utilization should be examined with caution in low-input cropping systems because the biochar effects were dependent on fertilizer level, biochar application rate, production temperature and their interactions. Further manipulative experiments are recommended to identify the mechanisms that explain the non-nutrient effect of biochar on yield.

AB  - Application of biochar technology in the remediation of organic contaminated soils has drawn growing interest in recent years. In this study, sorption and degradation of two typical neonicotinoid insecticides, imidacloprid (IMI) and clothianidin (CLO) in Chinese typical paddy soil and red soil amended with six kinds of biochars were investigated. The results showed that surface area (SA), pH, total organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of the two soils all increased after biochar amendment, while H/C decreased. With biochar pyrolyzing temperature (PT) increasing from 300 °C to 700 °C, the sorption of the two insecticides on biochar–soil mixtures increased by more than 4.3-fold, due to the increasing SA and decreasing H/C. The acidic pH of the two tested soils also favored the enhanced sorption of the insecticides by removing the ash on biochar. The amendment of low-PT (300 °C) biochar promoted the biodegradation of IMI and CLO by 11.3–41.9% via providing more DOC and available N for microorganisms, while inhibiting the chemical degradation. Oppositely, the high-PT (500–700 °C) biochars inhibited the biodegradation of the insecticides by decreasing their bioavailability and promoted the chemical degradation by providing mineral active groups, and generating ·OH and other free radicals. In addition, soil type also affected the effects of biochar remediation. The highest 60-day degradation extent was achieved for CLO (90.5%) and IMI (81.4%) in paddy soil by adding biochar derived from pig manure at 700 °C PT. In summary, the effect of biochar on the fate of organic contaminants in soil is a comprehensive result involving several processes and a systematic study considering the type and property of biochar and soil is needed to optimize biochar technology.

AB  - Plant uptake of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) and ions (Ag+) largely depends on their exchangeable and soil-bound fractions in soils, which may be influenced by biochar amendment. This study investigated the effects of biochar amendment (0.1% and 1.0%) on soil sorption of Ag NPs and Ag+, their soil-bound fractions, and their uptake and translocation by radish grown in a loamy sand soil spiked with 1 mg/kg Ag NPs or Ag+. Sorption of Ag+ to the soils was much greater than that of Ag NPs, mainly because negatively charged soil particles would attract Ag+, but repel negatively charged Ag NPs. Biochar amendment at 1.0% (by weight) significantly decreased the reducible fraction of Ag+ in the soils with and without radish plants and increased the oxidisable fraction of Ag NPs in the soils with radish plants. Biochar amendment had no significant effect on Ag uptake by radish plants (p > 0.05), probably due to low exchangeable Ag fractions in all experimental treatments. In this short-term experiment (35 days), the addition of 1 mg/kg Ag NPs or Ag+ did not substantially elevate the level of Ag in radish roots (0.05 ± 0.02–1.06 ± 0.98 mg/kg) and shoots (0.01 ± 0.00–0.03 ± 0.01 mg/kg), compared to the blank control (p > 0.05). Radish uptake of Ag NPs and Ag+ at the environmentally-relevant concentration was low with root concentration factors between 0.03 ± 0.03 to 0.29 ± 0.21 and root-to-shoot translocation factors between 0.08 ± 0.10 to 0.89 ± 1.21, which may partially explain the non-significant effect of biochar amendment on Ag uptake.

AB  - Beneficial microbes in soil biota are known to enhance plant growth by stimulating the nutrient supply and by devising certain mechanisms to cope up with the biotic (diseases) or abiotic (salinity, drought, and pollution) stresses. Owing to their effectiveness and sustainability concerns, the application of microbes in the agricultural sector has seen a positive surge recently. Biochar has been commended as an exemplary carrier material for beneficial microbes in the soil ecosystem. Biochar is generally produced from the waste biomasses, which not only resolve the management crisis of agricultural wastes but also render many benefits such as enhancement of soil properties, alteration of nutritional dynamics, removal of pollutants, and in the stimulation of beneficial microbial diversity in soil. The strategic application of biochar in agricultural land could help provide agronomic, economic, and environmental benefits. Since certain risks are associated with the application of biochar, attention needs to be paid while preferring for soil amendments. This present review focused on highlighting the role of microbes in plant growth. The influence of biochar on soil biota along with its detailed mechanisms was discussed further to delineate the scope of biochar in soil amendments. Further, the risks associated with the biochar amendments and the future perspectives in this research arena were highlighted.

AB  - Biochar is a carbon-rich material obtained after thermochemical conversion of biomass under no oxygen environment. The effect of biochar amendment on soil properties, such as water retention, infiltration and desiccation crack potential was studied in the recent years. However, the effect of biochar or feedstock type on these properties is not explicit. This study investigates the effect of two different (in terms of feedstock) types of biochar on the water retention, infiltration and desiccation cracking behavior of compacted silty sand. Water retention characteristics, infiltration rate and the progression of desiccation cracks were measured after compacting soil amended with 5–10% (w/w) biochar produced from water hyacinth (WHB) and mesquite. Measurements were also taken for an unpyrolyzed material coir pith (CP, sourced from coconut husk)-amended soil for comparing the results of biochar-amended soil. The results show that the amendment of 5% to 10% biochar increased the maximum water holding capacity (θs), air entry value (AEV) and water content at 1500 kPa (θ1500) of the soil, whereas decreased the infiltration rate and peak crack intensity factor (CIF) of the soil. Moreover, the application of CP increased the infiltration rate. The amendment of WHB showed the highest increment in AEV and θ1500 and the highest decrement in infiltration rate and CIF compared to the other amendments. Based on the results, it is advisable to use the WHB-amended soil in bioengineered structures that could promote the growth of vegetation by higher water retention and could reduce the potential of leachate formation by decreasing water infiltration and desiccation crack potential.

AB  - Biochar, an environmentally friendly soil conditioner, is produced using several thermochemical processes. It has unique characteristics like high surface area, porosity, and surface charges. This paper reviews the fertilizer value of biochar, and its effects on soil properties, and nutrient use efficiency of crops. Biochar serves as an important source of plant nutrients, especially nitrogen in biochar produced from manures and wastes at low temperature (≤ 400 °C). The phosphorus, potassium, and other nutrient contents are higher in manure/waste biochars than those in crop residues and woody biochars. The nutrient contents and pH of biochar are positively correlated with pyrolysis temperature, except for nitrogen content. Biochar improves the nutrient retention capacity of soil, which depends on porosity and surface charge of biochar. Biochar increases nitrogen retention in soil by reducing leaching and gaseous loss, and also increases phosphorus availability by decreasing the leaching process in soil. However, for potassium and other nutrients, biochar shows inconsistent (positive and negative) impacts on soil. After addition of biochar, porosity, aggregate stability, and amount of water held in soil increase and bulk density decreases. Mostly, biochar increases soil pH and, thus, influences nutrient availability for plants. Biochar also alters soil biological properties by increasing microbial populations, enzyme activity, soil respiration, and microbial biomass. Finally, nutrient use efficiency and nutrient uptake improve with the application of biochar to soil. Thus, biochar can be a potential nutrient reservoir for plants and a good amendment to improve soil properties.

AB  - This study assembled corn stalk-derived biochar (BC) with layered double hydroxide (LDH) through a rapid coprecipitation of biochar and metal (Ni/Fe/Zn) hydroxide precipitates. A BC and LDH composite (BC-LDH) and modified BC-LDH material after heating (BC-LDH-P) were prepared successfully for atrazine adsorptive removal. The physicochemical properties of the synthesized samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Batch experiments were conducted to study the sorption of atrazine onto BC, BC-LDH, and BC-LDH-P from the aqueous solution. The adsorption of atrazine onto BC-LDH and BC-LDH-P were performed following with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and the sorption isotherms agreed well with the Freundlich fitting model. The adsorption amounts of the three materials are arranged in descending order is as follows: BC-LDH-P > BC-LDH > BC (143.15 > 123.10 > 95.93 mg g−1, respectively). Due to the high crystallinity of the LDH material and the high binding degree with biochar, Ni/Fe/Zn-LDH biochar composites offer a potential alternative to a carbon-based adsorbent for atrazine removal from aqueous solution.

SP  - 421

VL  - 2
IS  - 4
AB  - Various studies have established that feedstock choice, pyrolysis temperature, and pyrolysis type influence final biochar physicochemical characteristics. However, overarching analyses of pre-biochar creation choices and correlations to biochar characteristics are severely lacking. Thus, the objective of this work was to help researchers, biochar-stakeholders, and practitioners make more well-informed choices in terms of how these three major parameters influence the final biochar product. Utilizing approximately 5400 peer-reviewed journal articles and over 50,800 individual data points, herein we elucidate the selections that influence final biochar physical and chemical properties, total nutrient content, and perhaps more importantly tools one can use to predict biochar’s nutrient availability. Based on the large dataset collected, it appears that pyrolysis type (fast or slow) plays a minor role in biochar physico- (inorganic) chemical characteristics; few differences were evident between production styles. Pyrolysis temperature, however, affects biochar’s longevity, with pyrolysis temperatures > 500 °C generally leading to longer-term (i.e., > 1000 years) half-lives. Greater pyrolysis temperatures also led to biochars containing greater overall C and specific surface area (SSA), which could promote soil physico-chemical improvements. However, based on the collected data, it appears that feedstock selection has the largest influence on biochar properties. Specific surface area is greatest in wood-based biochars, which in combination with pyrolysis temperature could likely promote greater changes in soil physical characteristics over other feedstock-based biochars. Crop- and other grass-based biochars appear to have cation exchange capacities greater than other biochars, which in combination with pyrolysis temperature could potentially lead to longer-term changes in soil nutrient retention. The collected data also suggest that one can reasonably predict the availability of various biochar nutrients (e.g., N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, and Cu) based on feedstock choice and total nutrient content. Results can be used to create designer biochars to help solve environmental issues and supply a variety of plant-available nutrients for crop growth.

AB  - Biochar has been extensively used for the improvement of soil water retention. However, the effects of various biochars were not well determined. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of three biochars [biochars made from bamboo (Bambusaceae), rice straw (Oryza sativa), and tobacco stem (Nicotiana L.)] on soil physical properties and the water retention characteristics of red soil at southeast China. The air-dried soil samples were mixed with ratios of 2%, 5%, and 10% (w w−1) BC (bamboo biochar), RC (rice straw biochar), and TC (tobacco biochar), respectively, and evaluated for changes in soil bulk density (BD), soil saturated water content, field capacity, capillary porosity and soil hygroscopic coefficient. The results showed that BD decreased significantly with the application of the three types of biochar, total soil porosity and capillary porosity increased with the increase of the biochar ratio. The soil hygroscopic coefficient, wilting moisture capacity, saturated water content, and field capacity were significantly affected by the application of the three types of biochar. Compared with the other two treatments, the BC showed the best effects on soil water characteristics. BC treatments with addition ratios of 2%, 5%, and 10% significantly decreased BD by 6.55%, 18.03%, and 36.07%, respectively. Moreover, saturated water content and field capacity were increased by BC. BC treatments significantly increased the readily available water by 32.65%, 42.49%, and 50.01%, respectively. However, the increased non-readily available water induced by the high ratio of biochar addition was not easily utilized by plants. Our results suggested that the biochar amendment can improve soil structure, decrease soil BD, boost soil porosity and capillary porosity, and increase soil moisture constant, and 2–5% of BC was recommended in the field condition.

AB  - Considering the global issue of vegetable wastes generation and its impact on the environment and resources, this study evaluated the conversion of four largely produced vegetable wastes (cauliflower, cabbage, banana peels and corn cob residues) into biochar. Each waste was tested individually and as a combined blend to assess feedstock influences on biochar properties. In addition, various pyrolysis temperatures ranging from 300 °C to 600 °C and two particle size fractions (less than 75 µm, 75–125 µm) were considered. Biochars were characterized for various properties that can influence the biochars’ effectiveness as a soil amendment. It was found that pyrolysis temperature was the most dominant factor on biochar properties, but that individual feedstocks produced biochars with different characteristics. The biochars had characteristics that varied as follows: pH 7.2–11.6, ECE 0.15–1.00 mS cm−1, CEC 17–cmolc kg−1 and ζ-potential − 0.24 to − 43 mV. Based on optimal values of these parameters from the literature, cauliflower and banana peels were determined to be the best feedstocks, though mixed vegetable waste also produced good characteristics. The optimum temperature for pyrolysis was around 400 °C, but differed slightly (300–500 °C) depending on the distinct feedstock. However, smaller particle size of biochar application was always optimal. Biochar yields were in the range of 20–30% at this temperature range, except for corn cobs which were higher. This study demonstrates that pyrolysis of dried vegetable wastes is a suitable waste valorization approach to produce biochar with good agricultural properties.

AB  - Biochars produced from cotton gin waste (CG) and guayule bagasse (GB) were characterized and explored as potential adsorbents for the removal of pharmaceuticals (sulfapyridine-SPY, docusate-DCT and erythromycin-ETM) from aqueous solution. An increase in biochar pyrolysis temperature from 350 οC to 700 οC led to an increase in pH, specific surface area, and surface hydrophobicity. The electronegative surface of all tested biochars indicated that non-Coulombic mechanisms were involved in adsorption of the anionic or uncharged pharmaceuticals under experimental conditions. The adsorption capacities of Sulfapyridine (SPY), Docusate (DCT) and Erythromycin (ETM) on biochar were influenced by the contact time and solution pH, as well as biochar specific surface area and functional groups. Adsorption of these pharmaceutical compounds was dominated by a complex interplay of three mechanisms: hydrophobic partitioning, hydrogen bonding and π–π electron donor–acceptor (EDA) interactions. Despite weaker π–π EDA interactions, reduced hydrophobicity of SPY− and increased electrostatic repulsion between anionic SPY− and the electronegative CG biochar surface at higher pH, the adsorption of SPY unexpectedly increased from 40% to 70% with an increase in pH from 7 to 10. Under alkaline conditions, adsorption was dominated by the formation of strong negative charge-assisted H-bonding between the sulfonamide moiety of SPY and surface carboxylic groups. There seemed to be no appreciable and consistent differences in the extent of DCT and ETM adsorption as the pH changed. Results suggest the CG and GB biochars could act as effective adsorbents for the removal of pharmaceuticals from reclaimed water prior to irrigation. High surface area biochars with physico-chemical properties (e.g., presence of functional groups, high cation and anion exchange capacities) conducive to strong interactions with polar-nonpolar functionality of pharmaceuticals could be used to achieve significant contaminant removal from water.

AB  - Rapid expansion of cultivated bamboo negatively impacts on biodiversity and soil microbial community. As such, it is important to properly manage and use bamboo to prevent and control such issues. This study focuses on optimizing pyrolysis conditions to produce bamboo biochar for agricultural soil amendment, particularly soil potassium (K) and water holding capacity. Bamboo chips were pyrolyzed under nitrogen gas at 400, 600, and 800 °C for 1 and 2 h of retention. A total of six biochar products were created: 400-1 (i.e., 400 °C in 1 h), 400-2, 600-1, 600-2, 800-1, and 800-2. The 600 °C bamboo biochar products were observed to have the greatest potential in increasing soil K and water holding capacity. The 600-1 product had the highest potassium content (4.87%), with a water holding capacity of 3.73 g g−1, while the 600-2 product had the second-highest potassium content (4.13%) and the highest water holding capacity (4.21 g g−1) and cation exchange capacity. The K release in 600 °C products was larger and slower than that of the 400 °C and 800 °C products, respectively. The results also indicated that the physicochemical characteristics of bamboo biochar, such as yield, pH, surface area, water holding capacity, and K content, were significantly impacted by temperature, retention time, or a combination of these parameters. The outcomes from this study are a valuable reference for bamboo biochar production targeting agricultural soil amendment, particularly when it is directed at increasing soil K and water holding capacity.

AB  - Biochar can enhance crop production and sequester carbon, but there have been few studies with tree crops. Rubber plantations cover more than 8 million hectares in Southeast Asia, so we assessed the feasibility of biochar application in these plantations with a pot trial. Rubber seedlings were planted in soil with four concentrations (0, 1.25%, 2.5% and 5%, w/w) of biochar combined with two concentrations of compound fertilizer (0 kg/ha and 300 kg/ha). Soil properties and seedling growth were measured, and a leaching experiment was conducted in the rainy season. Our results show that biochar increased pH, water content (27.4–65.1%), total carbon (25.4–53.6%), nitrate nitrogen, and available phosphorus in the soil, and decreased bulk density (3.2–23.9%). Biochar treatment reduced leaching of ammonium nitrogen and ortho-P. Biochar increased seedling nutrient uptake (C, N, P and K), with 2.5% and 5% biochar showing the largest effects, but seedling biomass was the highest with 1.25%, and declined in 2.5% and 5%. Our results suggest that biochar addition is an effective way to improve rubber plantation soils, sequester more carbon and decrease nutrient leaching, but the optimum application rate under field conditions needs further research.

TI  - Biochars reduce irrigation water sodium adsorption ratio
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 77

IS  - 1
AB  - Irrigation water quality plays a vital role in sustaining crop productivity and feeding a growing world population. In many countries, continued agricultural water reuse can lead to greater water-soluble salt concentrations, and in particular Na; finding means by which irrigation water Na, and thus sodium adsorption ratios (SAR), can be reduced would reduce the rate at which soil sodification occurs. Four biochars, containing a variety of organic functional groups and electrochemistries, were examined for their potential to sorb and remove Na from simulated irrigation water, and subsequently reduce water SAR. Two batch experiments examined the role that wheat straw biochar, lodgepole pine biochar, Kentucky bluegrass biochar, and hemp biochar played in terms of sorbing sodium over time or application rate. Of the four biochars examined, hemp biochar had the lowest oxidation–reduction potential (ORP; ~ 0–100 mV), sorbed the greatest Na amount (up to 923 mg kg−1), and released Ca and Mg (up to 115 and 63 mg kg−1, respectively) into solution, all of which led to a significant reduction in water SAR (from 8.8 to 7.3; 17% decrease). Sodium sorption onto hemp biochar better fit a Langmuir versus a Freundlich isotherm, yet followed a pseudo-second-order model better than a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The data suggest that Na ions formed a monolayer on the hemp biochar surface, influenced by associations with π electrons, but given time the Na ions may diffuse into biochar pores or more slowly interact with biochar-borne π electrons. Hemp biochar shows promise in reducing the SAR of Na-impacted waters. Future investigations should focus on additional laboratory, greenhouse, and field trials with hemp biochar and other biochars designed to have similar or superior properties for sorbing excess irrigation water Na and improving crop growth.

TI  - Woody biochar potential for abandoned mine land restoration in the U.S.: a review
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 7
EP  - 22
VL  - 3
IS  - 1
AB  - There are thousands of abandoned mine land (AML) sites in the U.S. that need to be restored to reduce wind and water erosion, provide wildlife forage, shade streams, and improve productivity. Biochar created from woody biomass that would normally be burned in slash piles can be applied to soil to improve soil properties and is one method to restore AML soil productive capacity. Using this ‘waste’ biomass for biochar and reclamation activities will reduce wildfire risk, air pollution from burning, and particulates released from burning wood. Biochar has the potential to improve water quality, bind heavy metals, or decrease toxic chemical concentrations, while improving soil health to establish sustainable plant cover, thereby preventing soil erosion, leaching, or other unintended, negative environmental consequences. Using forest residues to create biochar also helps reduce woody biomass and improves forest health and resilience. We address concerns surrounding organic and inorganic contaminants on the biochar and how this might affect its’ efficacy and provide valuable information to increase restoration activities on AMLs using biochar alone or in combination with other organic amendments. Several examples of AML biochar restoration sites initiated to evaluate short- and long-term above- and belowground ecosystem responses are presented.

AB  - Nano-black carbon (BC) is one of the most active fractions in the pyrogenic carbonaceous matter continuum. The majority of recent studies mainly focus on the role of nano-BC in the global carbon cycle. However, based on literature and our recent studies, we suggest that nano-BC may also serve as a super suspending agent, carrier, and redox mediator for sorbates during its migration from terrestrial to water bodies due to its unique properties such as high colloidal stability, strong sorption capacity, and high surface reactivity. The full implications of nano-BC in water/soil environments are far more than we expected. Thus, we call for more detailed investigations on the activity and reactivity of nano-BC in water/soil environments.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 105

VL  - 3
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar as an organic amendment improves soil attributes, with a potentially significant effect on soil chemical fertility and quality. The main objective of this study was to quantify the effect of biochar addition on nutrients, carbon sequestration and microbial activity and understand the mechanisms of controlling biochar effects in calcareous soils. Maize residue biochars produced at 200, 400 and 600 °C were added at 5 and 10 g kg−1 rates to sandy loam and clayey texture calcareous soils. The soil properties measured were pH and electrical conductivity (EC), plant-available potassium (K) and available phosphorus (P), total nitrogen (TN), C sequestration; and the fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis activity. Addition of raw material and biochars increased pH (0.15–0.46 units), EC (0.14–0.38 dS m−1), TN (63–120%), K (12–41%) and FDA activity (27–280%), but tended to decrease plant-available P (23–86%). Increasing pyrolysis temperature increased soil C pool index (CPI), but decreased the FDA and the changes depended largely upon the application rate and soil texture. The positive effects of biochar addition and its pyrolysis temperature on soil C sequestration potential were more pronounced at high than low application rate and in sandy loam than clayey soils. Nevertheless, the effect of biochar addition and pyrolysis temperature on the FDA activity was higher at high than low application rates, but lower in sandy loam than clayey soils. Although biochar application may successfully improve soil processes and attributes and have a high potential for C sequestration, its effects are controlled by soil texture, pyrolysis temperature and application rate.

SP  - 37

VL  - 3
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar is an effective absorbent for remediating heavy metal contaminated soil, but functional optimization is still needed to improve its performance in field application. Here, we characterized the physical structures and surface chemical properties of raw wood biochar and palm biochar (WB and PB) and the corresponding sulfhydryl-modified biochar (SWB and SPB). Their adsorption capacity for Pb was evaluated by combining thermodynamic and kinetic adsorption at 0.01 mol/L KCl and corresponding model simulation. The results demonstrated successful grafting of sulfhydryl groups onto the biochar, which dramatically reduced the specific surface area (SSA) and pore volume of biochar. The pKa in the surface complexation model (SCM) indicated similar proton affinity between sulfhydryl groups and original functional groups on the biochar. SCM could satisfactorily fit the Pb adsorption behaviors, and model analysis revealed that Pb tended to be adsorbed on low-proton affinity sites at low pH, but high-proton affinity sites became dominant in Pb adsorption with increasing pH and adsorbed almost all Pb ions at pH > 7.0. Besides, the Pb adsorption density of SWB and SPB was improved by 8.86 and 3.64 folds relative to that of WB and PB, respectively. Over 90% of initially added Pb ions were removed in 1440 and 720 min by raw and sulfhydryl-modified biochar, respectively, indicating that sulfhydryl modification accelerated the Pb adsorption of biochar. These results suggest that site density, SSA and pore structure of biochar play crucial roles in heavy metal adsorption, and sulfhydryl modification may improve the performance of biochar in remediating heavy metal contaminated soil.

AB  - Previous research showed that biochar addition facilitated composting and elevated nutrient retention. However, few of these studies explored bacterial structure and abundance in the compost mixture and biochar additive. Thus, this study aims to distinguish bacterial communities in both compost and bamboo biochar (BB) additive. Results indicated that the dynamics of nutrient contents in compost and BB samples were in a similar pattern, although there were lower levels of nutrients and metals (i.e., Cu and Zn) in BB additives. The total number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in both compost and BB additives peaked on day 7 and then gradually reduced during composting. There was more abundance of bacteria in compost, whereas the diversity of bacteria was more in BB additives. Furthermore, the dominant bacteria in compost and BB samples were distinct at the different stages of composting. The Firmicutes steadily decreased in compost samples (from 34.78% to 7.65%), while it was the dominant phylum in BB additives during the whole composting period. Furthermore, Ruminofilibacter, Pseudoxanthomonas, and Actinomadura were the most abundant genera in compost samples than Pseudoxanthomonas, Azoarcus, and Paenibacillus in BB additives at the final stage of composting. Results from this study could provide a theoretical reference for the sound performance of biochar-added composting.

AB  - Diclofenac is an ecotoxic pharmaceutical compound affecting both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems even at low concentrations. In this study, batch adsorption experiments were conducted to remove sodium diclofenac (SD) from aqueous solutions using rice hull biochar (RHB) adsorbents. Higher SD removals were obtained with increasing initial SD concentration, RHB dosage, contact time, and decreasing initial pH. Isotherm studies revealed that Langmuir isotherm best fitted the experimental data with the highest coefficient of determination for both pH 2 (R2 = 0.9827) and pH 7 (R2 = 0.9460). For kinetic studies, the pseudo second-order model gave R2 = 0.9999 for both pH 2 and pH 7. SD removals reached up to 97% at pH 2 and up to 80% at pH 7. Higher SD removals were achieved at solution pH lower than the adsorbent pHpzc since electrostatic repulsion was eliminated. Fourier-transform infrared analysis showed the major involvement of C=O in the adsorption process. This study demonstrated the potential of using agricultural residues such as rice hulls for the treatment of wastewater contaminated with pharmaceutical compounds.

EP  - 188
VL  - 3
IS  - 2
AB  - Great progress has been made in recent years to alleviate the heavy metal pollution, but the development of low-cost and eco-friendly adsorbents is still challenging. In this work, MgO-loaded biochar, as a potential adsorbent, was successfully synthesized via copyrolysis of corn straw and MgCl2∙6H2O at 600 ℃ and used for heavy metal immobilization in aqueous solution and contaminated soil. Nemerow pollution index and potential ecological risk index methods were also used to assess the potential ecological risk of the metals in soil after remediation. The results showed MgO-laden biochar exhibited a much higher Cd2+ adsorption capacity than the pristine biochar. Pseudo-second-order and Langmuir/Langmuir–Freundlich equations could describe the adsorption kinetics and isotherm of Cd2+ well. The maximum adsorption capacity of Cd2+ could reach to 1058.8 mg g−1 estimated by Langmuir–Freundlich equation. Cd2+ adsorption on MgO-laden biochar composite mainly involved the hydrolyzation of MgO, ionization of Mg(OH)2 and precipitation of Cd2+ and OH−. In addition, complexes with oxygen-containing groups and adsorption by Mg(OH)2 also enhanced Cd immobilization. The result of soil-leaching test showed that the concentrations of TCLP-leaching (Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure) Cd and Pb reduced by 22.4% and 29.0%, respectively, after 4% of MgO-laden biochar amendment, and the integrated pollution index and potential ecological risk decreased by 28.9% and 28.5%, respectively. These results suggest that MgO-laden corn straw biochar may be promising for application as a low-cost adsorbent for wastewater treatment and soil remediation.

IS  - 2
AB  - Many Hawaiian agricultural soils are acidic with low-nutrient retention; therefore, organic soil amendments are often used to improve soil properties and increase yields. Amendments can be incorporated for annual crops, but perennial orchards need surface application to avoid damaging surface roots. Pot trials compared responses to incorporated (IBC) or surface-applied (SBC) combination of hardwood biochar and chicken manure compost (4% v/v of each amendment) added to an Andisol and Oxisol. Soil pH was increased by 0.4–1.1 units in IBC and by 0.2–0.5 for SBC in the 0–10 cm soil layer. Both SBC and IBC increased soil total N, extractable P, Ca and Mg in the 0–10 cm soil layer. Soil pH, total C and extractable Ca were also higher in the 10–20 cm soil layer for IBC soil, indicating movement and/or leaching of amendments. Chinese cabbage biomass was 18–70% higher in the IBC and 14–47% higher in the SBC than that in the unamended soil, while papaya biomass was 23% and 19% higher in SBC and IBC, respectively. There was a greater response in the more acidic Andisol soil, with larger improvements in soil pH, plant nutrient uptake and root biomass than the Oxisol. Surface application was as effective in increasing plant growth as the incorporated amendment, providing evidence for farm scale assessment. Biochar and compost are recommended for use in tropical soils, and surface application may be beneficial to annual and perennial crops.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 149

VL  - 3
IS  - 2
AB  - Biochar has been proposed as a soil amendment to reclaim salt-affected soils. However, the evaluation of the different biochar types in these soils is essential due to the significant variation among biochar feedstocks. In this study, biochars from sugarcane bagasse (SB), orange bagasse (OB), and corncob (CB) were applied alone and in the presence of gypsum (G) to test their potential to remediate a highly degraded saline-sodic soil in Brazil´s Northeast region. For that, we conducted a laboratory column-leaching experiment and a greenhouse study. After the column-leaching test, we analyzed the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract (ECe), the concentrations of major ions, and the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP). Maize plants were grown in the leached soil in a greenhouse. Sugarcane- and corncob-derived biochars were more efficient than gypsum in reducing the soil salinity, bringing the indicators below threshold values, and optimizing soil reclamation time. Soil ECe, SAR, and ESP were reduced to 3.42 dS m−1, 1.64 (mmolc dm−3)0.5 and 4.86%, respectively, in the SB treatment; and to 3.19 dS m−1, 0.88 (mmolc dm−3)0.5 and 2.53%, respectively, in the CB treatment. Orange bagasse biochar did not effectively reduce the salinity indicators. All biochar treatments improved seed germination and plant growth. The SB, CB, SBG, and CBG treatments increased plant height (478–558%), shoot mass (783–983%), and root mass (386–500%), respectively. Therefore, the application of SB and CB is an effective alternative to remediate saline-sodic soils and to reduce the impact of soil salinity in the environment.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 135
EP  - 147
VL  - 3
IS  - 2
AB  - In view of the risks induced by the inhibitory effects of applying impracticably large amounts of sewage sludge biochar (SSB) to the alkaline soil, this field study investigated the influence of moderate biochar amendments (0, 1500, 4500, and 9000 kg/hm2) on corn growth, alkaline soil properties, and the uptake of potentially toxic elements (PTEs). The results showed that applying more SSB would decrease the ammonium nitrogen concentration and increase the available phosphorus and potassium concentrations, which inhibited corn plant growth because of high background nutrient levels of the alkaline soil. When the alkaline soil was amended with 1500 kg/hm2 SSB, the dry weight of 100 niblets increased from 32.11 g in the control to 35.07 g. There was no significant variation in the total concentration of PTEs in the soil. The concentrations of Mn, Ni, Cu, and Zn in niblets decreased from 5.54, 0.83, 2.26, and 27.15 mg/kg in the control to 4.47, 0.62, 1.30, and 23.45 mg/kg, respectively. Accordingly, the health risk from corn consumption was significantly reduced. Furthermore, the combination of SSB and fertilizer improved corn growth and reduced the risk of consumption of PTEs. Therefore, considering the increase in corn fruit yield and the decrease in consumption risk, applying 1500 kg/hm2 of biochar to alkaline soils is a realistically achievable rate, which can broaden the utilization of SSB for remediation of different types of soil.

VL  - 3
IS  - 3
AB  - Biomass and pig manure have distinct compositions and the co-pyrolysis of them has gained much attention. However, the influence of volatiles interaction on the properties of the char was still unclear. In this study, lignin was selected as the model component of biomass with pig manure for co-pyrolysis at 600 °C. The results indicate that volatiles from co-pyrolysis promoted re-condensation reaction, resulting in the higher char yield (48.0% in co-pyrolysis versus 31.0% in pyrolysis of single manure) and the formation of more aromatics in bio-oil. The co-pyrolysis also facilitated the dehydrogenation and dehydration reactions, which accounted for the elimination of oxygen and nitrogen contents and thus a higher carbon content (64.7% in the co-pyrolysis versus the averaged value of 46.4% from the pyrolysis of single feedstock), higher crystallinity and thermal stability of the char. The in-situ diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) characterization results demonstrated that the functionalities abundances of char with temperature was influenced by volatiles interaction via accelerating the carbonization reaction. In addition, the high heating value (HHV) of char was obviously improved by cross-interaction of volatiles during co-pyrolysis (24.4 MJ/Kg in co-pyrolysis versus averaged value of 15.1 MJ/Kg from single pyrolysis), implying that the co-pyrolysis enhanced the energy density of the resulting char.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 23

VL  - 3
IS  - 1
AB  - The transformation of mercury (Hg) into the more toxic and bioaccumulative form methylmercury (MeHg) in soils and sediments can lead to the biomagnification of MeHg through the food chain, which poses ecological and health risks. In the last decade, biochar application, an in situ remediation technique, has been shown to be effective in mitigating the risks from Hg in soils and sediments. However, uncertainties associated with biochar use and its underlying mechanisms remain. Here, we summarize recent studies on the effects and advantages of biochar amendment related to Hg biogeochemistry and its bioavailability in soils and sediments and systematically analyze the progress made in understanding the underlying mechanisms responsible for reductions in Hg bioaccumulation. The existing literature indicates (1) that biochar application decreases the mobility of inorganic Hg in soils and sediments and (2) that biochar can reduce the bioavailability of MeHg and its accumulation in crops but has a complex effect on net MeHg production. In this review, two main mechanisms, a direct mechanism (e.g., Hg-biochar binding) and an indirect mechanism (e.g., biochar-impacted sulfur cycling and thus Hg-soil binding), that explain the reduction in Hg bioavailability by biochar amendment based on the interactions among biochar, soil and Hg under redox conditions are highlighted. Furthermore, the existing problems with the use of biochar to treat Hg-contaminated soils and sediments, such as the appropriate dose and the long-term effectiveness of biochar, are discussed. Further research involving laboratory tests and field applications is necessary to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the role of biochar in reducing Hg bioavailability in diverse soil types under varying redox conditions and to develop completely green and sustainable biochar-based functional materials for mitigating Hg-related health risks.

AB  - At present, many researchers have studied the modification of biochar and explored the adsorption of cadmium by modified biochar. The adsorption capacity of cadmium for general modified biochar is about 30–150 mg/g. The new biochar (BM) we studied greatly improves the adsorption effect of cadmium in water, and the maximum adsorption capacity of cadmium can reach 400 mg/g, so we tried to apply it to the passivated cadmium in polluted farmland soil. This paper discusses the mechanism of BM passivation of heavy metal cadmium in soil and its protective effect on crop growth. The study found that: (1) the content of cadmium in wheat was 3.98 mg/kg in the soil with BM800. The addition of BM800 reduced the cadmium content of wheat by 75.43% compared with the blank control group; (2) BM contains special iron-containing functional group (–Fe–OOC–, –Fe–R–COOH, –Fe–R–OH, etc.) and aromatic structure C=Cπ, and these structures can react with cadmium to form stable complexes (C=Cπ–Cd, (FeO)2Cd, (Fe–RO)2Cd, etc.); (3) there are special mineral crystal structures XiFeYjOk in BM. XiFeYjOk can react with cadmium to form Cd–XiFejOk. Cd–XiFejOk can stably exist in biochar, and can provide more adsorption sites, which strengthens the adsorption and passivation of cadmium in soil by BM.

TI  - An investigation of the effects of hydrochar application rate on soil amelioration and plant growth in three diverse soils
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 349
EP  - 365
VL  - 3
IS  - 3
AB  - The hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of biogas digestate alters the raw materials inherent characteristics to produce a carbon (C)-rich hydrochar (HC), with an improved suitability for soil amelioration. Numerous studies report conflicting impacts of various HC application rates on soil properties and plant growth. In this study, the influence of HC application rate on soil improvement and plant growth aspects was investigated in three diverse soils (Chernozem, Podzol, and Gleysol). Pot trials were conducted in which all soils were amended with 5, 10, 20 and 30% (w/w) HC in quintuplicate, with two controls of pure soil (with and without plants, respectively) also included. Prior to potting, soil samples were collected from all HC-amended soils and controls and analyzed for soil pH, plant available nutrients (PO4-P and K), and microbial activity using standard laboratory and statistical methods. Immediately after potting, a 6-week seed germination experiment using Chinese cabbage was conducted to determine germination success, followed by a plant growth experiment of equal duration and plant species to determine biomass success. At the end of the study (after a total plant growth period of 12 weeks), each pot was sampled and comparatively analyzed for the same soil properties as at the beginning of the study. Soil pH shifted toward the pH of the HC (6.6) in all soils over the course of the study, but was most expressed in the 20% and 30% application rates, confirming the well-documented liming effect of HC. The addition of HC increased the PO4-P and K contents, particularly with 20% and 30% HC amendments. These results are proposedly due to the large labile C fraction of the HC, which is easily degradable by microorganisms. The rapid decomposition of this C fraction prompted the quick release of the HCs inherently high PO4-P and K content into the soil, and in turn, further stimulated microbial activity, until this fraction was essentially depleted. HC addition did not inhibit seed germination at any rate, presumably due to a lack of phytotoxic compounds in the HC from aging and microbial processes, and furthermore, showed no significant impact (positive or negative) on plant growth in any soil, despite improved soil conditions. In conclusion, although less pronounced, soil improvements were still achievable and maintainable at lower application rates (5% and 10%), whereas higher rates did not ensure greater benefits for plant growth. While the addition of high rates of HC did not detrimentally effect soil quality or plant growth, it could lead to leaching if the nutrient supply exceeds plant requirements and the soil’s nutrient retention capacity. Therefore, this study validates the previous study in the effectiveness of the biogas digestate HC for soil amelioration and suggests that smaller regularly repeated HC applications may be recommendable for soil improvement.

AB  - Combined application of biochar with fertilizers has been used to increase soil fertility and crop yield. However, the coupling mechanisms through which biochar improves crop yield at field scale and the time span over which biochar affects carbon and nitrogen transformation and crop yield are still little known. In this study, a long-term field trial (2013–2019) was performed in brown soil planting maize. Six treatments were designed: CK—control; NPK—application of chemical fertilizers; C1PK—low biochar without nitrogen fertilizer; C1NPK, C2NPK and C3NPK—biochar at 1.5, 3 and 6 t ha−1, respectively, combined with chemical fertilizers. Results showed that the δ15N value in the topsoil of 0–20 cm layer in the C3NPK treatment reached a peak of 291 ‰ at the third year (2018), and demonstrated a peak of 402 ‰ in the NPK treatment in the initial isotope trial in 2016. Synchronously, SOC was not affected until the third to fourth year after biochar addition, and resulted in a significant increase in total N of 2.4 kg N ha−1 in 2019 in C3NPK treatment. During the entire experiment, the 15N recovery rates of 74–80% were observed highest in the C2NPK and C3NPK treatments, resulting in an annual increase in yields significantly. The lowest subsoil δ15N values ranged from 66‰ to 107‰, and the 15N residual rate would take 70 years for a complete decay to 0.001% in the C3NPK. Our findings suggest that biochar compound fertilizers can increase C stability and N retention in soil and improve N uptake by maize, while the loss of N was minimized. Biochars, therefore, may have an important potential for improving the agroecosystem and ecological balance.

AB  - Biochar is the carbon-rich product obtained from the thermochemical conversion of biomass under oxygen-limited conditions. Preparation methods contribute to biochar properties, which are widely concerned in the agronomic and environmental benefits of agro-ecosystems. This research aims to use bibliometrics methods to comprehensively and objectively analyze the research trends in the global biochar production field from 2006 to 2019 based on the Web of Science Core Collection database. The results showed that 1434 papers related to biochar preparation were published, which gradually increased each year. The research topics were diversified, which were mainly divided into “Environmental Sciences and Ecology,” “Engineering” and “Agriculture”. Moreover, Bioresource Technology was the most published journal contained biochar preparation. Authors from China had the most publications, followed by the US, Australia and the UK. Meanwhile, Yong Sik Ok from Korea University contributed most of the publications and had the highest H-index. Keywords analysis indicated that biochar preparation by pyrolysis was a current hotspot, of which microwave and hydrothermal were a future research trend. Besides, gasification would be used to develop new biomass energy. Biochar has the characteristics of high pH, high specific surface area, high carbon content, and rich functional groups. It is mainly used in soil improvement, water pollutant adsorption, carbon sequestration and emission reduction, and energy storage materials, etc. Furthermore, raw materials, pyrolysis temperature and pyrolysis time will also affect its characteristics and applications. It is expected that this study may provide insight into the future research interests regarding biochar preparation.

TI  - Biochar from sawmill residues: characterization and evaluation for its potential use in the horticultural growing media
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 201
EP  - 212
VL  - 3
IS  - 2
AB  - Peat remains the primary constituent of horticultural growing media in professional use. However, use of peat in horticultural growing media results in greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss due to excavation of natural peatlands. Biochar is gaining attention as a sustainable alternative to peat use in horticulture. This study examined the potential of biochar produced from a particular type of sawmill residue, as a partial replacement for peat in horticultural growing media. Five treatments including peat only, biochar only, biochar and peat in 1:1, 1:3, and 3:1 (V/V) ratios were assessed. The addition of biochar into growing media increased the pH and EC of the medium. However, physical properties (air-filled porosity and water holding capacity) were negatively affected with the increase in biochar content in the medium. According to the germination test results, biochar significantly improved germination and the shoot and root length of germinated seeds of cress, lettuce and tomato when compared to peat-only and biochar-only treatments. The inclusion of biochar in 25–50% volume ratio improved plant growth parameters compared to peat-only and biochar-only media. Results obtained from this study suggest that sawmill residue offers great potential as a feedstock for biochar production and inclusion of biochar has positive effects on seed germination and plant growth that might compete with modified peat.

AB  - The Oronogo-Duenweg mining belt is a designated United States Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site due to lead-contaminated soil and groundwater by former mining and smelting operations. Sites that have undergone remediation—in which the O, A, and B horizons have been removed alongside the lead contamination—have an exposed C horizon and are incalcitrant to revegetation efforts. Soils also continue to contain quantifiable Cd and Zn concentrations. To improve soil conditions and encourage successful site revegetation, our study employed three biochars, sourced from different feedstocks (poultry litter, beef cattle manure, and lodgepole pine), at two rates of application (2.5%, and 5%), coupled with compost (0%, 2.5% and 5% application rates). Two plant species—switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides)—were grown in the amended soils. Amendment of soils with poultry litter biochar applied at 5% resulted in the greatest reduction of soil bioavailable Cd and Zn. Above-ground biomass yields were greatest with beef cattle manure biochar applied at 2.5% with 5% compost, or with 5% biochar at 2.5% and 5% compost rates. Maximal microbial biomass was achieved with 5% poultry litter biochar and 5% compost, and microbial communities in soils amended with poultry litter biochar distinctly clustered away from all other soil treatments. Additionally, poultry litter biochar amended soils had the highest enzyme activity rates for β-glucosidase, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase, and esterase. These results suggest that soil reclamation using biochar and compost can improve mine-impacted soil biogeophysical characteristics, and potentially improve future remediation efforts.

AB  - Water washing is a meaningful method to improve the surface’ characteristic of hydrochar produced using hydrothermal carbonization and minimize the negative effect on crop growth. However, the greenhouse effect resulting from water-washed hydrochar application was unclear in agricultural ecosystems. Hence, the effect of water-washed hydrochar on methane and nitrous oxide emissions was analyzed in an infertile paddy soil based on a soil-column experiment. Sawdust-derived hydrochar (WSH) and wheat straw-derived hydrochar (WWH) after water washing were selected and applied with low (5‰, w/w; 8.5 t ha−1) or high addition rate (15‰, w/w; 25.5 t ha−1). The study indicated that water-washed hydrochar could increase the grain yield; the difference between WWH with 5‰ application rate and CKU treatments was significant. WSH significantly decreased CH4 and N2O emissions in comparison with WWH addition treatments. For the same material, there were trends in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at low application rate, although the differences were not significant. Compared with all treatments, WSH with 5‰ application rate achieved the lowest seasonal emissions for both GHGs. The mcrA gene was the critical factor affecting CH4 emission; soil NO3−–N concentration and the copy numbers of nirK, nirS, and nosZ jointly affected N2O emissions. Benefits from the high yield and low global warming potential, GHG emission intensity (GHGI) at low application rate was lower than at high application rate for WSH. Overall, the response of GHG emissions to water-washed hydrochar varies with the derived feedstock; WSH is a good additive for the mitigation of GHGI.

AB  - Little information is available on thallium (Tl) adsorption onto biochar amended soil for a relatively long term. In this study, bamboo-derived biochar (BDB), soil in pomelo orchard (SP), and biochar amended soil in pomelo orchard (BSP) were thus used to evaluate the potential remediation of thallium (Tl) using batch-adsorption techniques. Furthermore, we characterized the above-mentioned sorbents’ properties related to Tl adsorption to understand Tl’s adsorption mechanisms. The results showed that BDB, SP, and BSP achieved equilibrium adsorption capacity of 96.9, 95.43, and 96.76%, respectively, within the initial 15 min. This means that compared to other sorbents, BSP exhibited an efficient sorbent for Tl remediation even when applied in the agricultural field for one year. Multi-layer adsorption played a dominant role in the adsorption of Tl, which was supported by the suitability of Freundlich model for describing the adsorption behavior of Tl onto the selected sorbents. In addition, the pseudo-second kinetic order models strongly fitted Tl’s adsorption onto BDB, SP, and BSP, indicating that the process was accompanied by chemical adsorption. Observed on the surface of BDB by a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) and an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the presence of O–H groups and PO43− might promote chemical adsorption of Tl onto BDB. Overall, these findings can provide insights into comprehensively developed bamboo-derived biochar technology to remediate Tl contamination in agricultural soils.

AB  - Biochar has been reported to mitigate short-term methane (CH4) emissions from paddy soil. Currently, CH4 mitigation by biochar has primarily focused on the abundance and variations of methanogens and methanotrophs, and changes in their activities during methane production and consumption. However, long-term effects of biochar on methane mitigation from paddy soil remain controversial. This review overviewed the existing mechanisms for CH4 mitigation as a result of biochar application. In addition, the two existing opinions on the long-term CH4 mitigation effect upon biochar application were highlighted. Combining the already explored mechanisms of fresh biochar on CH4 mitigation from paddy soil and a novel discovery, the potential mechanisms of biochar on long-term methane emission response were proposed. This review also revealed the uncertain responses of biochar on long-term CH4 mitigation. Therefore, to achieve carbon neutral goal, it is important to further explore the mechanisms of long-term CH4 mitigation under biochar application.

AB  - Soil aggregation is one of the crucial processes that facilitate carbon sequestration and maintain soil fertility. So far, the effect of biochar amendment on soil aggregation remains inconclusive. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the response of soil aggregation to biochar addition varied with incubation duration and biochar chemistry. A one year microcosm experiment of soil with biochar was conducted that included biochar produced at three different temperatures (300, 450, and 600 °C), and three biochar application rates, i.e., 0, 1, and 3 wt%. It was observed that after one and three months, biochar mainly (> 90%) distributed in the micro-aggregates, and slightly reduced aggregate stability and increased proportion of micro-aggregates, which was demonstrated to result from the mechanical mixture of amended biochar with soil. Contrastingly, when the duration was prolonged to six months and one year, a significant increase in macro-aggregates (6.6–38.5%) and aggregate stability (7.3–29.4%) was detected, with the increasing extent being apparently higher for low-temperature biochar. This was related to the comparatively strong interaction of biochar particles with soil minerals or microbes after long-time incubation. The strong interaction was directly supported by the significant increase in H/C, O/C ratios of isolated biochar from treated soils, the detection of typical soil mineral elements on the surface of isolated biochar, and the increase in microbial biomass carbon of treated soils. The findings of this study highlighted the role of biochar type and amendment duration in mediating the effect of biochar application on soil aggregation.

AB  - With the fast development of industrialization and urbanization, large amounts of organic pollutants are released into the natural environment. The efficient elimination of organic pollutants is thereby crucial for environmental pollution treatment and human health. In the last decades, photocatalytic degradation of persistent organic pollutants has attracted multidisciplinary interest because of its simple operation on a large scale. However, the whole processes for the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants are still unclear. In this perspective, the contribution of reactive species, the contribution of photocatalysts, the analysis of intermediate products, the charge transfer and fast carrier recombination are discussed on biochar-based photocatalysts.

AB  - Soil microorganisms play crucial roles in soil nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, fertility maintenance and crop health and production. To date, the responses of microorganisms, such as microbial activity, diversity, community structure and nutrient cycling processes, to biochar addition have been widely reported. However, the relationships between soil microbial groups (bacteria, fungi and microscopic fauna) and biochar physicochemical properties have not been summarized. In this review, we conclude that biochar affects soil microbial growth, diversity and community compositions by directly providing growth promoters for soil biota or indirectly changing soil basic properties. The porous structure, labile C, high pH and electrochemical properties of biochar play an important role in determining soil microbial abundance and communities, and their mediated N and P cycling processes, while the effects and underlying mechanisms vary with biochar types that are affected by pyrolysis temperature and feedstock type. Finally, we highlight some issues related to research methodology and subjects that are still poorly understood or controversial, and the perspectives for further research in microbial responses to biochar addition.

AB  - The effects of uncoated and Fe-coated biochars (BC) on the removal of bacteria, microspheres, and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in sand filters were compared. Filters were packed with 1.2 or 2.0-mm sand mixed with 30% (vol/vol) uncoated BC, Fe-coated BC, or a control without BC. Removal of E. coli, Salmonella, and Enterococci increased from 23, 42, and 25% in the unamended 1.2-mm sand to 48, 80, and 75% in the uncoated BC treatment, though only the increase for Enterococci was significant (p < 0.05). For the Fe-coated BC, removal efficiencies were 89, 93, and 94%, respectively, which were all significantly (p < 0.05) greater than the unamended sand but only the removal of E. coli was significantly greater than the uncoated BC sand filter. For the 2.0-mm sands, the only significant increase in removal following BC addition was observed for Salmonella. Trends in microsphere removal were generally consistent with bacteria. Removal of DRP in the unamended and uncoated BC filters was 33 and 13% (p > 0.05), respectively, whereas removal in the Fe-coated BC filters was 98% (p < 0.05). Results from batch sorption experiments indicate that both BCs similarly increased bacterial sorption to sand. In contrast, DRP sorption to the unamended and uncoated BC-amended sands were similar (p > 0.05) with DRP sorption to the Fe-coated BC-amended sand being significantly greater (p < 0.05). Results indicate that Fe-coated BC is more effective at retaining DRP than bacteria and microspheres in sand filters.

AB  - Biochar (BC) has exhibited a great potential to remove water contaminants due to its wide availability of raw materials, high surface area, developed pore structure, and low cost. However, the application of BC for water remediation has many limitations. Driven by the intense desire of overcoming unfavorable factors, a growing number of researchers have carried out to produce BC-based composite materials, which not only improved the physicochemical properties of BC, but also obtained a new composite material which combined the advantages of BC and other materials. This article reviewed previous researches on BC and BC-based composite materials, and discussed in terms of the preparation methods, the physicochemical properties, the performance of contaminant removal, and underlying adsorption mechanisms. Then the recent research progress in the removal of inorganic and organic contaminants by BC and BC-based materials was also systematically reviewed. Although BC-based composite materials have shown high performance in inorganic or organic pollutants removal, the potential risks (such as stability and biological toxicity) still need to be noticed and further study. At the end of this review, future prospects for the synthesis and application of BC and BC-based materials were proposed. This review will help the new researchers systematically understand the research progress of BC and BC-based composite materials in environmental remediation.

VL  - 3
IS  - 4
AB  - Biochar obtained from a biomass pyrolytic polygeneration technology exhibits great potential as an adsorbent, because of its renewability, porosity and desirable surface chemical properties. Pyrolysis temperature and feed are important elements in the preparation of biochar. Thus, the effects of these factors on the physicochemical properties of biochar were investigated in this study. The adsorption of biochar was evaluated using water, CO2, phenol, and methylene blue (MB) as adsorbates. The correlation between adsorption capacity and physicochemical properties was determined using the Pearson correlation. Results indicated that temperature could significantly affect the structure of biochar. The effects of biomass species were also noticeable as well. The number of macropores and their contribution to the total surface area for cotton stalk, bamboo, and rapeseed stalk increased with an increase in temperatures, meanwhile, the number of micropores decreased at high temperatures. At the same temperature, the macropore, mesopore, and micropore components of biochar produced by different species were markedly different. The water adsorption and CO2 adsorption of biochar were close to those of commercial activated carbon (AC), whereas the adsorption capacity of untreated biochar on phenol and MB was less than that of AC. Porosity exerted more significant effects on the adsorption capacity of biochar, compared with functional groups. The surface area of the micropores exhibited a significant positive correlation with the adsorption of CO2, phenol, and MB. The hydroxyl group was positively correlated with water adsorption.

AB  - Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are increasingly threatened by pesticide pollution resulting from extensive use of pesticides, and due to the lack of regulatory measures in the developing world, there is a need for affordable means to lessen environmental effects. This study aimed to investigate the impact of biochar amendment on the toxicity of imidacloprid to life-cycle parameters and biomarker responses of the earthworm Eisenia fetida. E. fetida was exposed to 10% biochar-amended and non-amended OECD artificial soils spiked with 0, 0.75, 1.5, 2.25 and 3 mg imidacloprid/kg for 28 days. An LC50 of 2.7 mg/kg was only computed in the non-amended soil but not in the biochar-amended soil due to insignificant mortality. The EC50 calculated in the non-amended soil (0.92 mg/kg) for reproduction (fertility) was lower than the one computed in the biochar amended (0.98 mg/kg), indicating a decrease in toxicity in the biochar-amended substrate. Significant weight loss was observed at the two highest imidacloprid treatments in the non-amended soil and only at the highest treatment in the biochar-amended substrate, further highlighting the beneficial effects of biochar. Catalase activity decreased significantly at the two highest concentrations of non-amended soil. Yet, in the amended soil, the activity remained high, especially in the highest concentration, where it was significantly higher than the controls. This indicated more severe oxidative stress in the absence of biochar. In all non-amended treatments, there was a significant acetylcholinesterase inhibition, while lower inhibition percentages were observed in the biochar-amended soil. In most endpoints, the addition of biochar alleviated the toxic effects of imidacloprid, which shows that biochar has the potential to be useful in soil remediation. However, there is still a need for field studies to identify the most effective application rate of biochar for land application.

VL  - 3

AB  - Biochar pores in the micrometer range (1–100 µm) derive from cellular structures of the plant biomass subjected to pyrolysis or can be the result of mechanical processing, such as pelleting. In this study, synchrotron X-ray microtomography was used to investigate the internal pore structure of softwood pellet biochar produced by slow pyrolysis at 550 and 700 °C. The microtomographic data sets consisted of 2025 images of 2560 × 2560 voxels with a voxel side length of 0.87 µm. The three-dimensional reconstructions revealed that pelleting and pyrolysis significantly altered the pore structures of the wood feedstock, creating a network of connected pores between fragments that resembled the wood morphology. While higher pyrolysis temperature increased the specific surface area (as determined by BET nitrogen adsorption), it did not affect the total observed porosity. Multifractal analysis was applied to assess the characteristics of the frequency distribution of pores along each of the three dimensions of reconstructed images of five softwood pellet biochar samples. The resulting singularity and Rényi spectra (generalized dimensions) indicated that the distribution of porosity had monofractal scaling behavior, was homogeneous within the analyzed volumes and consistent between replicate samples. Moreover, the pore distributions were isotropic (direction-independent), which is in strong contrast with the anisotropic pore structure of wood. As pores at the scale analyzed in this study are relevant, for example, for the supply of plant accessible water and habitable space for microorganisms, our findings combined with the ability to reproduce biochar with such pore distribution offer substantial advantages in various biochar applications.

AB  - This study addressed a comparative assessment of the effect of low-cost catalysts on the yield and physicochemical properties of bio-oil. Thermal and catalytic pyrolysis of neem seeds (NM) was conducted in a fixed bed semi-batch reactor at optimum conditions (550 °C temperature, 80 °C min−1 heating rate, 0.5 mm particle size, and 100 mL min−1 sweep gas flow rate). The produced bio-oil and biochar were characterized through thermal stability, elemental composition (CHNS), higher heating value (HHV), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS), zeta potential, water-holding capacity (WHC), and BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) surface area analyzer. Overall, it was noticed that the use of catalysts at optimized condition substantially boosted the quality and yield of bio-oil. Pyrolysis results established that thermal pyrolysis yielded 49.53 wt.% of bio-oil, while catalytic pyrolysis yielded (51.25 wt.%, 53.12 wt.%, 48.68 wt.%, and 50.65 wt.% for MgO, NaOH, Al2O3, and ZSM-5, respectively) at 20 wt.% catalyst loading. The physicochemical study of bio-oil confirmed improved properties of bio-oil in terms of viscosity, heating value, pH and carbon content. Further, the FTIR study of bio-oil indicates the occurrence of phenolic products, aromatics, ketones, acidic compounds, esters, alcohol and aldehyde impurities, whereas 1H NMR study supported FTIR findings. GC–MS study demonstrated that the introduction of catalysts significantly reduced the oxygenated substances, acidic products, phenolic compounds and substantially increased the hydrocarbons. Further, characterization results of neem seed biochar (NMC) established the existence of HHV (23.26 MJ kg−1), carbon content (62.66%), zeta potential (31.68 mV), water holding capacity (41.50%) and lower BET surface area (4.60 m2 g−1).

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 457

VL  - 3
IS  - 4
AB  - Biochars, when applied to contaminated solutions or soils, may sequester potentially toxic elements while releasing necessary plant nutrients. This purpose of this study focused on quantifying both phenomenon following wheat straw (Triticum aestivum L.) biochar application (0, 5, and 15% by wt) to a Cd containing solution and a Cd-contaminated paddy soil using 240-day laboratory batch experiments. Following both experiments, solid phases were analyzed for elemental associations using a combination of wet chemical sequential extractions and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). When wheat straw biochar was applied at 15% to Cd containing solutions, Cd and Zn concentrations decreased to below detection in some instances, Ca and Mg concentrations increased by up to 290%, and solution pH increased as compared to the 5% biochar application rate. Similar responses were observed when biochar was added to the Cd-contaminated paddy soil, suggesting that this particular biochar has the ability to sequester potentially toxic elements while releasing necessary plant nutrients to the soil solution. When significant, positive correlations existed between nutrient release over time, while negative correlations were present between biochar application rate, potentially toxic element sorption and pH. The latter suggests that potentially toxic elements were sorbed by a combination of organic functional groups or mineral precipitation based on whether pH was above or below ~ 7. In support of this contention, the wet chemical sequential extraction procedure in conjunction with previously observed Cd or current Zn XAS showed that biochar application promoted the formation of layered double hydroxides, sorption to (oxy)hydroxides, and organically bound to biochar as Zn species. As a multi-functional material, biochar appears to play an important role in sequestering Cd while releasing essential plant nutrients. These findings suggest that biochar may be a ‘win–win’ for improving environmental quality in potentially toxic element contaminated agroecosystems.

AB  - To explore the effect of biochar on alleviating plant drought stress after being applied to soil, we prepared biochar using rice straw as raw material according to different pyrolysis temperatures (400, 600 and 800 °C) and reaction atmosphere (CO2 and N2). The effect of different pyrolysis conditions on the water retention performance of biochar was studied. The early high water-retaining biochar materials were selected and wheat seeds were selected for the verification experiment of returning to the field in pots. Biochar with high porosity (specific surface area and total pore volume) and more surface hydrophilic functional groups (mainly –OH and –COOH) can indeed improve soil water retention performance. It is mainly reflected in the increase in the dry weight and fresh weight of wheat and the soil moisture content in the treatment group with the addition of biochar water retention agent. Among them, the growth rates of fresh weight and dry weight of wheat in the C800 treatment group were 11.51% and 10.64%, and the soil moisture content increased by 1.89%. It is worth noting that the application of biochar cannot completely alleviate the impact of drought stress on plants, but it can reduce the amount of water irrigation to a certain extent. Considering the quality of biochar, the biochar material (C800) prepared under the pyrolysis temperature of 800 °C and the reaction atmosphere of CO2 has high water retention performance.

VL  - 3
IS  - 4
AB  - Cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) contaminated soils that are used for food production can lead to metal bioaccumulation in the food chain and eventually affect human health. In these agroecosystems, means by which Cd and Pb bioavailability can be reduced are desperately required, with biochar as a proxy for bioavailability reductions. Molecular Cd and Pb sorption mechanisms within short- (0–2 years) or long-term (8–10 years) time periods following biochar application to a contaminated rice paddy soil were investigated. A combination of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and soft X-ray imaging was utilized to discern potential metal sorption mechanisms. Following both short- and long-term biochar applications, soil Cd and Pb bioavailable fractions shifted partially towards metal (hydr)oxide and carbonate precipitates, and partially towards biochar-organic function group associations; oxygen-containing groups, such as C=O and O–H, appeared to bind Cd and Pb. Soft X-ray imaging results suggested that heavy metals were primarily sorbed on biochar exterior surfaces, yet given time and particle disintegration, metals sorbed onto biochar interior pore walls. Findings suggest that biochar may play a pivotal role in reducing long-term bioavailable Cd and Pb in contaminated soils. Observations also support previous findings that suggest biochar use can lead to reduced heavy metal transfer to plants and potentially to reduced heavy metal consumption by humans.

SP  - 519
EP  - 533
VL  - 3
IS  - 4
AB  - Mining and excavation activities cause massive degradation of land, leading to complete loss of soil resources, vegetation, and biodiversity. Mine spoils support invasive weeds (predominantly Lantana) which can strive in these harsh conditions, causing allelopathy during plantation stage of reclamation. It is hypothesised that biochar produced from invasive weeds will enhance enzymatic activity, CO2 flux and overall fertility of coal mine spoil. A 6-month incubation study was conducted on the effect of biochar amendment (2 and 3%, w/w) on mine spoil enzymatic activities (dehydrogenase, invertase, amylase and cellulase), respiration and coal mine spoil fertility. The study showed that biochar significantly improved dehydrogenase (83%) and cellulase activity (78%) at 3% amendment. Geometric mean of enzymatic activities increased from 1.87 in control to 4.51 at 2% and 3.25 at 3% biochar amendment. Mine spoil physio-chemical properties such as soil organic carbon (65%), cation exchange capacity (54%), bulk density (25%) and water holding capacity (19%), were improved significantly compared to the unamended mine spoil. Biochar amendment reduced mine spoil CO2 flux at 2% (2.85 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1) and 3% (2.60 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1) compared to control (4.92 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1). The cost of biochar production and application (2%, w/w) in pit plantation during reclamation is estimated to be 844 USD t ha−1 (plantation density: 1600 trees ha−1). On the basis of present study, biochar preparation from invasive weeds can be used for sustainable reclamation of coal mine spoil.

AB  - The purpose of this paper was to study the effects of different C/N ratios on the maturity and microbial quantity of composting with sesame meal and rice straw biochar. Rice straw was calcined into biochar as raw materials composting with sesame meal for 30 days, referring to Chenfu Agricultural Book in Sōuthern Song Dynasty (1127–1279 A.D.). Sesame meal was used to adjust the C/N ratio of compost, and three treatments were designed in the experiment, which were C/N ratios of 15, 20 and 30, respectively. The results showed that C/N ratio of 20 was beneficial for promoting the temperature rise, the removal of water, the degradation of organic carbon, and the decrease of microbial quantity. The C/N ratio of 20 was beneficial to the compost maturity (T value was 0.47, final GI was 99.67%). The results of Pearson correlation analysis showed that C/N ratio was positively correlated with moisture content, total organic carbon and negatively correlated with germination index, indicating that high C/N ratio was beneficial to water removal and total organic carbon degradation. Therefore, we suggest that the suitable C/N ratio of rice straw biochar and sesame meal is 20. At the same time, we have proved that the composting method in Southern Song Dynasty is feasible, which is of great significance to understand the development of composting in China.

AB  - Pesticide residues have seriously damaged the natural environment and social security. Here, we prepared the efficient functional biochar (FB) for sulfonylurea herbicides from cotton straw cellulose (CSC) by hydrothermal carbonization with the methacrylic acid. The molecular simulation of FB indicated that π-π electron-donor–acceptor (EDA) interaction and formation of charge-assisted H-bond were both the main factors for effective adsorption process. The adsorption process can match the pseudo-second-order kinetic equation and Freundlich model. The whole process is physical adsorption, spontaneous and rapid, and can quickly reach equilibrium. The FB with carbon–oxygen functional groups and aromatic conjugated structures can remove pesticides in water very quickly (within 30 s), with effective adsorption over 95% of Sulfonylurea herbicides (SUHs). Therefore, functional FB might be an effective way to get excellent absorbent for pesticide treatment.

VL  - 3
IS  - 4
AB  - Recent studies have shown that silicon (Si) dissolution from biochar may be influenced by the pyrolysis temperature. In addition, the enhancement of biochar by treatment with alkali has been proposed to produce a Si source that can be used for environmentally friendly plant disease control. In this study, biochars from rice straw and rice husk pretreated with KOH, CaO and K2CO3 and then pyrolyzed at 350, 450 and 550 °C were prepared to evaluate the effects of pyrolysis temperature on Si release and plant uptake from alkali-enhanced Si-rich biochar. Extractable Si and dissolution Si from the prepared biochars were assessed by different short-term chemical methods and long-term (30-day) release in dilute acid and neutral salt solutions, respectively, along with a rice potting experiment in greenhouse. For both rice straw- and husk-derived alkali-enhanced biochars (RS-10KB and HS-10K2B, respectively), increasing the pyrolysis temperature from 350 to 550 °C generally had the highest extractable Si and increased Si content extracted by 5-day sodium carbonate and ammonium nitrate (5dSCAN) designated for fertilizer Si by 61–142%, whereas non-enhanced biochars had more extractable Si at 350 °C. The alkali-enhanced biochars produced at 550 °C pyrolysis temperature also released 82–172% and 27–79% more Si than that of 350 °C produced biochar in unbuffered weak acid and neutral salt solutions, respectively, over 30 days. In addition, alkali-enhanced biochars, especially that derived from rice husk at 550 °C facilitated 6–21% greater Si uptake by rice and 44–101% higher rice grain yields than lower temperature biochars, non-enhanced biochars, or conventional Si fertilizers (wollastonite and silicate calcium slag). Overall, this study demonstrated that 550 °C is more efficient than lower pyrolysis temperature for preparing alkali-enhanced biochar to improve Si release for plant growth.

SP  - 499
EP  - 509
VL  - 3
IS  - 4
AB  - The application of Fe–Mn-modified biochar for the remediation of Cd-contaminated soil over long time periods has been little studied. In this paper, we describe the performance of coconut-shell-derived biochar modified with ferromanganese in relation to soil Cd stabilization and rice Cd bioaccumulation during a 3-year laboratory study. Different application dosages (0.05–0.5 wt%) and different rice varieties (the early and late rice) are also considered. The results show that ferromanganese is mainly loaded in biochar pores as MnFe2O4, and that it decreases the specific surface area (SSA) and total pore volume of biochar. Ferromanganese biochar (0.5 wt%) applied to paddy soil is more effective than the same dose of pristine biochar in decreasing the soil-exchangeable Cd fraction (27.42–41.92% vs 22.56–33.85%), predominantly by decreasing soil Eh and increasing root Fe plaques. Ferromanganese biochar application helps to reduce Cd bioaccumulation in rice, especially in the grain (up to 48.6%–61.0%), and grain Cd levels (0.2 mg/kg) are all within the acceptable limit for food security in China. It is shown that ferromanganese modification and application can maintain soil at low redox status, keep root Fe plaques at a high level, and may also increase the stability of pristine biochar. All of these effects contribute to maintaining its high remediation efficiency over a 3-year inoculation period. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the potential applications of ferromanganese biochar in soil remediation and the improvement of food safety.

AB  - Biochar has been considered as a potential way to enhance acidophilous plant growth in alkaline soils. However, whether such enhancements are closely linked with biochar pyrolysis temperature and its improvements in rhizospheric soil fertility and microbial activities remains largely unknown. We performed a pot experiment to investigate changes in azalea (Rhododendron) morphology and physiology, as well as its rhizosphere soil chemical and biological properties in a slightly alkaline urban soil under the amendment of biochars that pyrolyzed at three temperatures (i.e., 350, 550 and 700 °C). Our results showed that the effects of biochars on plant growth and soil properties depended on pyrolysis temperature. In comparison with the non-amended control, 350 and 550 °C biochars showed significant promotions on the azalea growth in terms of photosynthetic characteristics, biomass, root morphology, and N and P uptake. Whereas, 700 °C biochar showed an inhibition effect on them. 350 °C biochar decreased soil pH and increased soil available P and K contents and the activities of α-glucosidase, N-β-glucosaminidase, phosphatase and sulfatase. In addition, 350 °C biochar significantly enhanced bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal 18S rRNA gene abundances in the rhizosphere soil of azalea and mycorrhizal infection. Correlation analysis indicated that soil pH, available nutrients and fungal abundance had positive associations with the enhanced plant growth parameters. Therefore, our findings suggest that biochar produced at low temperature could be a feasible strategy for enhancing acidophilous azalea growth and improving urban soil quality.

SP  - 437

VL  - 3
IS  - 4
AB  - A number of processes for post-production treatment of “raw” biochars, including leaching, aeration, grinding or sieving to reduce particle size, and chemical or steam activation, have been suggested as means to enhance biochar effectiveness in agriculture, forestry, and environmental restoration. Here, I review studies on post-production processing methods and their effects on biochar physio-chemical properties and present a meta-analysis of plant growth and yield responses to post-processed vs. “raw” biochars. Data from 23 studies provide a total of 112 comparisons of responses to processed vs. unprocessed biochars, and 103 comparisons allowing assessment of effects relative to biochar particle size; additional 8 published studies involving 32 comparisons provide data on effects of biochar leachates. Overall, post-processed biochars resulted in significantly increased average plant growth responses 14% above those observed with unprocessed biochar. This overall effect was driven by plant growth responses to reduced biochar particle size, and heating/aeration treatments. The assessment of biochar effects by particle size indicates a peak at a particle size of 0.5–1.0 mm. Biochar leachate treatments showed very high heterogeneity among studies and no average growth benefit. I conclude that physiochemical post-processing of biochar offers substantial additional agronomic benefits compared to the use of unprocessed biochar. Further research on post-production treatments effects will be important for biochar utilization to maximize benefits to carbon sequestration and system productivity in agriculture, forestry, and environmental restoration.

VL  - 3
IS  - 4
AB  - Poultry litter biochar is known to improve crop productivity. However, its beneficial interactions with chemical fertilizer and/or organic manure on rice yield and nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) are not well studied. The objective of this study was to co-apply poultry litter biochar (hereinafter biochar) and chemical fertilizer and/or Azolla as organic manure (herein N fertilizer sources) to improve the productivity of rice and NUE. Eight treatments—no amendments (control), chemical fertilizer (NPK), Azolla as green manure (Azolla), and NPK + Azolla without and with biochar amendment—were evaluated in a pot trial. Selected rice plant growth components, yield, and NUE were determined. Compared to the treatments without biochar, co-application of biochar and N fertilizer sources significantly improved grain N uptake by 23.9% and NUE by 34.3–246.9%. These treatments also significantly improved rice growth components (5.6–18.2%) and grain yield (32.4%). Significant changes in soil properties including increases in pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total N, organic carbon, and available phosphorus were observed following biochar application. Except for the soil pH and EC parameters, no significant synergistic interactions between biochar and N fertilizer sources were observed for any parameters in the present study. Notably, compared to other treatments, the co-application of biochar and Azolla offers a feasible approach to improve rice productivity and NUE and reduce chemical fertilizer use, thereby reducing agricultural pollution and production costs.

SP  - 535

VL  - 3
IS  - 4
AB  - A batch experiment was conducted to examine the effects of biochar dose and reaction duration on the transformation and immobilization of Cr(VI) in the combined biochar and low-molecular-weight organic acid systems. The results showed that increase in the dosage level of biochar caused increase in the solution pH, particularly for the Biochar300 treatments but did not enhance the reduction of Cr(VI) after 1-day reaction. Over 35% of the converted Cr(III) was immobilized by sorption to the biochar due to increased negatively charged sites on the biochar surfaces driven by pH rise. The elevated pH due to biochar dose increase tended to slow down the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), resulting in more Cr(VI) being adsorbed at a higher biochar dose. For the higher-temperature biochars, the increase in biochar dose did not markedly change the transformation and immobilization of the added Cr. Increase in the reaction duration markedly increased the pH for Biochar300. This resulted in the disappearance of all Cr(VI) in the solution after the 7-day reaction, possibly through sorption of cationic Cr(III) to the biochar surfaces. Increase in reaction time for the higher-temperature biochars resulted in re-oxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) due to the increased exposure of solution Cr(III) to atmospheric oxygen. The research findings obtained from this study have implications for optimizing treatment procedure for wastewater that contains elevated level of toxic Cr(VI). Simulation experiments are required to determine appropriate biochar dose and reaction time to achieve cost-effective treatment goals.

SP  - 565

VL  - 3
IS  - 4
AB  - In response to increasing concerns over climate change, soil health and wine quality, grape growers are seeking new practices (e.g., biochar application) to minimize their environmental footprint while increasing productivity and the quality of their products. To explore the potential of biochar-based amendments to achieve these goals in wine grape production, vineyard trials were established in the fall of 2018. Two Oregon sites were chosen with distinct soil types and climates (Willamette Valley and Rogue Valley) but planted with the same grapevine scion/rootstock Pinot noir combination. Four treatments were applied under vines at each location: no biochar-no tillage (NT); no biochar + tillage (B0); 18 tons ha−1 biochar + tillage (B18); 35 tons ha−1 biochar + tillage (B35). In 2019, a suite of soil health, plant, and crop variables were measured, and wines were produced after harvest. The incorporation of biochar modified the chemical and physical composition of soils at the two studied locations, increasing the bioavailability of carbon and nitrogen, their gravimetric water content and the concentration of plant available micro and macro nutrients. No responses of plant physiology parameters or productivity at either site were found after biochar incorporation when compared with controls. Conversely, a significant and gradual decrease in the amount of wine tannins was found as a result of biochar application in wines produced from grapes from the Woodhall location. Long-term field experiments are required to assess the effects of biochar on soil properties, vine physiology, productivity, and grape and wine quality several years after incorporation.

AB  - Biochar has trigged increasing attention in the last decade due to its multiple functionalities, in which, color is not only the visual appearance, but also a useful indicator of relevant properties as well as an important tool to predict biochar’s properties. However, biochar color characterization remains challenged currently. In this work, three different feedstock-derived biochars were produced and basic color information (from color spaces RGB, HSB and CIE L*a*b*) of their scanned images was extracted. Then principal component analysis (PCA) and nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) were employed on the combinations of different color indexes to cluster biochars. With the assumption that clusters from both PCA and NMDS were as consistent as possible with that of visual intuition of biochar color, we identified feedstock-independent color indexes [(R + G-B)/(R + G + B), (R + B-G)/(R + G + B), (G + B-R)/(R + G + B), L, a, b] to characterize color of biochar, which can in microscopic perspective elucidate color differences with respect to pyrolysis temperature and feedstock type. Finally, prediction ability of color indexes with biochar yield as model property was explored and good performance was observed for both partial least squares regression (R2 = 0.8653) and neural network regression (R2 = 0.9720) with the latter being more powerful. The proposed color indexes will find more applications in prediction of biochar properties and functions in future.

VL  - 3

AB  - This study presents a scientometric analysis on biochar research to investigate the research status and developments as well as future trends in this field in 2020. A total of 3671 publications were retrieved from the Web of Science core collection database in 2020, which were analyzed for categories, countries, authors, and keywords. China and USA played a leading role in the research of biochar. Yong Sik Ok and Daniel C. W. Tsang were the most prolific authors in the application of biochar in agriculture, environment, and energy. Based on the keywords clustering analysis, biochar applications in “bioenergy production”, “global climate change mitigation”, “salinity and drought stress amelioration”, “organic pollutants degradation”, “heavy metals immobilization”, and “bioremediation” were the main hotspots. Biochar for salinity and drought stress amelioration became the focus in biochar area in 2020 as biochar amendment had great potential in alleviating salt- and drought-affected soils. Organic pollutants’ degradation via advanced oxidation process (AOPs) represents a sustainable growing topic. Radical and non-radical pathways were summarized for AOPs. Bioremediation using functional bacteria (e.g., heavy metal-resistant bacteria and organic pollutant-degraders) immobilized on biochar was still a research hotspot. Immobilized cells showed excellent performance in removing various contaminants by combining the advantages of highly efficient physiochemical sorption of biochar and microbial metabolisms. The review improves our understanding on scientific advances and potential future research directions in biochar research.

AB  - Biochar, a known soil amendment, has been found to alleviate plant or soil-borne diseases. However, the related mechanisms are poorly understood, especially from the perspective of microbes colonizing in raw biochar. In this study, laboratory studies, including isolation, adsorption, antifungal test, were employed to investigate biological characteristic of a fungus isolated from aging biochars (peanut shell biochar, rice husk biochar and bamboo biochar), as well as antimicrobial mechanisms on Fusarium species which cause wheat crown rot and Fusarium head blight (FHB). Furthermore, the field trial was conducted to investigate the effect of this fungus on spikelet disease rate and crop yield. The results were as follows: the isolated fungus was identified as Papiliotrema flavescens (P. flavescens), which was confirmed from ambient air, and its properties were characterized, such as the optimal growth pH and the growth curve. The mixed action of 1 × 106 cells/mL P. flavescens and 1 × 106 cells/mL Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) had the best antifungal effect, reaching an antifungal rate of 86.5%. The P. flavescens exerted antifungal effects through potential competition among nutrition, space, and parasitism, not from producing antifungal substances. Results from the field trial showed that the presence of P. flavescens could reduce the spike disease rate by 43.2% and increase the yield by 34.5%. In summary, the present study provides novel evidence about microbes from aging biochars that can prevent wheat crown rot and FHB.

AB  - Porous carbon aerogel material has gained an increasing attraction for developing supercapacitor electrodes due to its cost-effective synthesis process and relatively high electrochemical performance. However, the environmental performances of supercapacitor electrodes produced from different carbon aerogel materials are never comparatively studied, hindering our knowledge of supercapacitor electrode production in a sustainable pattern. In this study, nitrogen-doped biochar aerogel-based electrode (BA-electrode) produced from Entermorpha prolifera was simulated to investigate the environmental performance by using life cycle assessment method. For comparison, the assessment of graphene oxide aerogel-based electrode (GOA-electrode) was also carried out. It can be observed that the life cycle global warming potential for the BA-electrode was lower than that of GOA-electrode with a reduction of 53.1‒68.1%. In comparison with GOA-electrode, the BA-electrodes endowed smaller impacts on environment in majority of impact categories. Moreover, in comparison with GOA-electrode, the environmental damages of BA-electrode were greatly decreased by 35.8‒56.4% (human health), 44.9‒62.6% (ecosystems), and 87.0‒91.2% (resources), respectively. The production stages of GOA and graphene oxide and stages of nitrogen-doped biochar aerogel production and Entermorpha prolifera drying were identified as the hotspots of environmental impact/damage for the GOA-electrode and BA-electrode, respectively. Overall, this finding highlights the efficient utilization of algae feedstock to construct a green and sustainable technical route of supercapacitor electrode production.

IS  - 4
AB  - Soil amendment with biochar alleviates the toxic effects of heavy metals on microbial functions in single-metal contaminated soils. Yet, it is unclear how biochar application would improve microbial activity and enzymatic activity in soils co-polluted with toxic metals. The present research aimed at determining the response of microbial and biochemical attributes to addition of sugarcane bagasse biochar (SCB) in cadmium (Cd)-lead (Pb) co-contaminated soils. SCBs (400 and 600 °C) decreased the available concentrations of Cd and Pb, increased organic carbon (OC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contents in soil. The decrease of metal availability was greater with 600 °C SCB than with 400 °C SCB, and metal immobilization was greater for Cd (16%) than for Pb (12%) in co-spiked soils amended with low-temperature SCB. Biochar application improved microbial activity and biomass, and enzymatic activity in the soils co-spiked with metals, but these positive impacts of SCB were less pronounced in the co-spiked soils than in the single-spiked soils. SCB decreased the adverse impacts of heavy metals on soil properties largely through the enhanced labile C for microbial assimilation and partly through the immobilization of metals. Redundancy analysis further confirmed that soil OC was overwhelmingly the dominant driver of changes in the properties and quality of contaminated soils amended with SCB. The promotion of soil microbial quality by the low-temperature SCB was greater than by high-temperature SCB, due to its higher labile C fraction. Our findings showed that SCB at lower temperatures could be applied to metal co-polluted soils to mitigate the combined effects of metal stresses on microbial and biochemical functions.

TI  - Microwave-assisted combustion to produce benzene polycarboxylic acids as molecular markers for biochar identification and quantification
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 407
EP  - 418
VL  - 3
IS  - 4
AB  - Biochar is a promising carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technology for climate change mitigation. Current procedures for its determination are lengthy, labor-intensive, and difficult to conduct. Benzene polycarboxylic acids (BPCA) are the most promising molecular markers for identification and quantification of biochar and its quality as they specifically represent the stable polyaromatic backbone of biochar. Therefore, using the BPCA method, its stability and, thus, its C sequestration potential could be used for CDR accounting. The current BPCA method relies on a specific high-pressure digestion apparatus, which is not available around the world. Therefore, the aims of the present work were (i) to compare the conventional high-pressure nitric acid oxidation with a microwave-assisted digestion technique and optimize the oxidation conditions in such a way that previous results are comparable with future ones, and (ii) to significantly reduce the digestion time of soil samples of 8 h and to develop a suitable routine method that produces comparable and reproducible results. For this purpose, soil and control sample series were prepared for different temperature–time-program. Obtained results were compared with the values of the conventional method both for individual samples and for the whole dataset separately. To ensure the representativeness of the results, in addition to various soil samples with different properties, we included two reference materials into our data set, one without biochar (wheat flour) and a biochar sample. Our results showed that conventional nitric acid oxidation in the BPCA determination at 170 °C and 8 h can be substituted by digestion in a microwave reaction system (CEM Mars6) at 190 °C and 1 h. Our results further showed that this condition needs to be strictly matched, because, otherwise, over- or underestimation of biochar quantity and/or quality will be the consequence. The goal of a less time-consuming BPCA extraction from soil samples was achieved by reducing the extraction time from 8 to 1 h using the microwave-assisted method. However, one disadvantage of the new method is that five times more sample material and chemicals are needed for further BPCA analysis, compared to the original method.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 4
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Compacted clay possesses a low water permeability and has been widely used in geo-environmental facilities such as landfill cover systems. Recent studies revealed the potential applications of compacted biochar-amended clay (BAC) as an alternative landfill cover soil. However, the effects of biochar on the soil water retention curves (SWRCs) of clay at low suction are not known. This study can help fill this knowledge gap by measuring the wetting and drying SWRCs of clay and BAC (20% biochar). Soils were compacted in instrumented soil columns and subjected to a wetting and drying cycle, and soil water content and suction were measured along with the soil depth. BAC was saturated faster when compared with clay. Upon drying, the soil water content of clay at 65 mm depth dropped to almost zero, while about 5% of water was retained in BAC. It showed that biochar increased the soil water retention capacity of compacted clay upon drying. SWRCs showed that biochar-clay composite possesses a higher soil water retention capacity at a low soil suction range (< 1000 kPa) compared with clay alone. It revealed the benefits of using compacted biochar-clay composite as a hydraulic barrier to minimize desiccation-induced cracks and potentially promote its serviceability, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. The composite is also a carbon sink material that can reduce landfill gas emissions and pollutant leaching.

VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - The current study investigated the effect of biochars derived from cinnamomum woodchip, garden waste and mulberry woodchip on soil phytoavailable lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) pools, and their uptake by Chinese cabbage (Brassica chinensis L.). The biochars were produced at 450 °C of pyrolysis temperature. The contaminated soils were collected from Yunfu (classified as Udept), Jiyuan (Ustalf) and Shaoguan (Udult) cities in China at the depth of 0–20 cm and amended with biochars at the rate of 3% w/w. After mixing the soil with biochar for 14 days, the Chinese cabbage was planted in the amended soils. Then, it was harvested on the 48th day after sowing period. In Udult soil, Chinese cabbage died 18 days after sowing period in control and soils amended with cinnamomum and mulberry biochars. Although only plants grown with the garden waste biochar treatment survived in Udult soil, amendment of garden waste or mulberry biochars at 3% w/w (450 °C) to Udult soil significantly increased (4.95–6.25) soil pH compared to other biochar treatments. In Udept and Ustalf soils, the application of garden waste and mulberry biochars significantly improved plant biomass compared to control, albeit it was dependent on both biochar and soil properties. Garden waste biochar significantly decreased soil Cd phytoavailable concentration by 26% in the Udult soil, while a decrease of soil Cd phytoavailable concentration by 16% and 9% was observed in Ustalf and Udept soils, respectively. The available phosphorus in biochar and soil pH were important factors controlling toxic metal phytouptake by the plant. Thus, the amendment of soil with biochar at 3% can effectively reduce the mobility of Cd and Pb in soil and plant uptake. However, biochar and soil properties should be well-known before being used for soil toxic metal immobilization.

VL  - 4

AB  - Little attention has been paid to how long-term application of crop straw and its biochar affects soil phosphorus (P) transformation and carbon (C) fractions. We conducted a 7-year field experiment including control treatment (chemical fertilizer only, CK), straw return (2.25 t ha−1), and different amounts of biochar addition (11.25 t ha−1 (0.5%BC) and 22.5 t ha−1 (1.0%BC), to investigate influence of these amendments on soil C structure, P fractions, and their interaction with microorganisms. The 13C nuclear magnetic resonance and soil P sequence fractionation were applied to capture changes of soil C compositions and P pool. Compared to CK, straw and biochar amendments decreased alkyl C/O-alkyl C, which is conducive to increased soil organic C. The 0.5%BC and 1.0%BC treatments enhanced recalcitrant aromatic C by 69.0% and 131%, respectively. Compared to CK (101.2 ± 33.32 mg kg−1), the 0.5%BC and 1.0%BC treatments had a negligible effect on soil available P, while negative effects were observed in straw treatment (59.79 ± 9.023 mg kg−1). Straw and biochar amendments increased primary P and occluded P, whereas had negligible effect on organic P. Redundancy analysis and correlation analysis indicated that C compositions and P pool correlated to microbial community composition and enzyme activities, and aromatic C was the most related factor. Moreover, structural equation modeling indicated available P was most related to phosphatase activity and C composition. Our findings reveal the changes of soil P and C response under long-term crop straw and its biochar amendment, and can contribute toward improving understanding of the effect of biochar and straw return in future agriculture management.

TI  - High performance removal of sulfamethoxazole using large specific area of biochar derived from corncob xylose residue
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 11
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - To remove antibiotics from waste water, an alkali active porous biochar, 850BC, was prepared from corncob xylose residue. In preparation, NaOH dipping was used for silicon removal and KOH activation was operated at 850℃. Further characterization containing BET, SEM, and FTIR were confirmed. 850BC possessed a huge specific surface area of 3043 m2·g−1, developed pore structure and abundant oxygen functional groups. The adsorption performance of sulfamethoxazole on 850BC was quick and efficient, and the adsorption capacity reached 1429 mg·g−1, which was significantly higher than other adsorbents reported previously. While pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir model could better describe the adsorption, chemisorption dominated the SMX adsorption onto 850BC. In virtue of pore-filling and π–π interaction as major mechanism, a large surface area and rich oxygen-containing functional groups led to an excellent adsorption performance. Thus, this preparation method provided a biochar-based adsorbent with enhanced specific surface for efficient removal of antibiotic pollutants.

TI  - Silicate minerals control the potential uses of phosphorus-laden mineral-engineered biochar as phosphorus fertilizers
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 2
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Silicate minerals constitute the main components in silicon (Si)-rich biomass, affecting the phosphorus (P) adsorption and release competencies of mineral-engineered biochar; however, the mechanisms underlying their differences remain largely unresolved. To examine these interactions, we investigated the mineralogical compositions and quantified the P-adsorption capacities of Al-, Fe-, Mn-, Zn-, and Mg-engineered biochars from Si-rich rice husk material. The potential uses of P-laden mineral-engineered biochar for P fertilizers were assessed using citric acid extraction. The results from X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry revealed that mixed metal (oxyhydr)oxides and metal-silicate compounds precipitated in the biochar structure and acted as the main P adsorbents. Micro-crystalline silicates derived from the biomass-induced metal-silicate precipitates in all engineered biochars, which effectively retained the aqueous P with varying excellent capacities (25.6–46.5 mg/g) but relatively slow kinetics (48 h). The suitability of the Zn-, Mg-, Mn-, and Fe-biochars as P-recycled fertilizers was confirmed by the high amounts of citric acid extractable P (19–69% of the total P). Varying amounts of Zn, Mg, and Mn (34–47% of the total host metals) were also released from the engineered biochar through ligand-promoted dissolution. Our data shed light on the novel potential utilization of Mn-, Mg- and Zn-biochars from Si-rich biomass for P retrieval and their use for P, Mg, and micronutrient (Mn and Zn) fertilizers. Regarding the P removal capacity, the mineral-engineered biochar needed a longer adsorption period than conventional metal-engineered biochar.

TI  - Magnetic Fe2O3/biochar composite prepared in a molten salt medium for antibiotic removal in water
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 3
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - The large-scale use of antibiotics is causing serious water pollution problems, and it is of great significance to develop new technologies to remove antibiotics from water. As an environmentally friendly and economical adsorption material, carbon derived from biomass is a low-cost and feasible material for removing antibiotics in sewage, but the current removal efficiencies are not high enough for large-scale practical application. In this study, poplar wood chips are used as raw material, and a magnetic biochar is prepared by co-pyrolysis of poplar wood chips and FeCl3/CaCl2 mixed molten salt. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), N2-isothermal adsorption and desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques showed the successful synthesis of Fe2O3/bioC composite. In-situ formed Fe2O3 makes the biochar possess the characteristic of superparamagnetic, which is conducive to the recycling of biochar. Due to the etching effect of the molten salts, rough surface was formed on Fe2O3/bioC, resulting in a maximum norfloxacin (NOR) adsorption ability up to 38.77 mg g−1 at pH 6.0. The NOR adsorption behavior on Fe2O3/bioC followed the pseudo second order kinetic model and the equilibrium data was best fitted the Langmuir model. In addition, the adsorption process of NOR on Fe2O3/bioC was thermodynamically spontaneous. The results show that this low-cost and reusable magnetic biochar has the potential for rapid and efficient removal of antibiotic from aqueous solution.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 10
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - In recent years, numerous investigations have explored the use of biochar for the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants in single component systems. Biochar is a carbonaceous material produced from waste biomass, mainly by thermochemical conversion methods. This material was used as a biosorbent in various removal processes of pollutants, and its efficiency was strongly influenced by the characteristics of the biomass feedstock. This review integrates the recent works of literature to understand the biosorption behaviour of dyes onto biochar-based biosorbents. The factors influencing the biosorption process and the mechanisms describing the biosorption behaviours of the biochar have been broadly reviewed. Furthermore, the biosorption models can be used to comprehend the competence of the biochar as biosorbent for dye removal techniques.

TI  - Characterization of biochars from woody agricultural wastes and sorption behavior comparison of cadmium and atrazine
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 27
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Woody agricultural wastes have created enormous pressure on the environment. In this study, mulberry and cinnamon woodchips were reclaimed and prepared for biochars through pyrolysis technique at four different temperatures. Physicochemical properties showed that mulberry biochar exhibited higher pH, CEC and ash content than cinnamon biochar at each temperature. All biochars were utilized as adsorbents to remove cadmium (Cd) and atrazine (AT) from water. The adsorption isotherms were found to be well fitted by Freundlich and Langmuir models. The maximum adsorption capacities were 5306.41 mg/kg for Cd adsorption and 538.89 mg/kg for AT adsorption, respectively. Moreover, the principal component analysis, XPS and FTIR analysis proved that precipitation with phosphate in biochars acted as the key property that governed the adsorption capacity of Cd, whereas the porosity demonstrated a significant impact on the adsorption capacity of AT. Partial least squares (PLS) model was considered to be more favorable for predicting AT adsorption than Cd adsorption. The results of the present paper will be helpful for selecting most effective biochars from locally available woody agricultural byproducts that are optimized for contaminants removal from environment.

TI  - Biochar-induced changes in the soil diazotroph community abundance and structure in a peanut field trial
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 26
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) can help replenish available nitrogen (N) in cropland and reduce the use of chemical N fertilizers, with diazotrophs playing an important role. However, the response of diazotroph community and BNF activity in biochar amendment soil, especially in the deep soil horizon, are poorly understood. In this study, soil samples were collected from topsoil (0–20 cm) and subsoil (20–40 cm) in the field experiment (established in 2013) comprising treatments with no chemical fertilizer (CK), chemical fertilizer (NPK), biochar (BC), and biochar plus chemical fertilizers (BNPK). Here, we investigated the diazotroph community using real-time PCR and high-throughput sequencing of the nifH gene, and assessed the soil N2 fixation rate (RNfix) using acetylene reduction assay (ARA). Results showed that in the topsoil, the treatments with biochar significantly increased nifH gene copies and RNfix, which was consistent with the increased soil organic matter (SOM), total carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C/N), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and pH. In the subsoil, applying chemical fertilizers (NPK) strongly decreased RNfix, but had no effect on diazotroph abundance; in contrast, biochar application (BC) had no effect on RNfix, but suppressed the growth of bacteria and diazotrophs while increasing the abundance of Rhizobiales order. Diazotroph and bacterial gene copies were significantly and positively correlated in both top- and sub-soil, and they were mainly influenced by SOM and total nitrogen (TN). In addition, soil nitrate nitrogen (NO3−–N) was the major factor in shaping the vertical stratification of diazotroph community structure. Although nifH gene abundance was significantly correlated with RNfix in the topsoil, the structure equation modeling (SEM) showed the highest correlation between diazotroph community structure and RNfix. Hence, we suggested that soil carbon and nitrogen sources were the key factors correlated with changes in the vertical pattern of diazotroph abundance. Biochar induced the dominant diazotroph community succession and increased soil carbon content and pH, which contributed to the BNF activity. Changes in the BNF activity were driven by the variation in diazotroph community structure.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 15
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Dissolved organic matter plays a critical role in affecting sorption properties of biochar for organic contaminants. In this study, dissolved humic acid (DHA) as a representative of dissolved organic matter and oak sawdust-derived biochar as a sorbent were prepared and characterized. Roles of DHA in sorption of benzotriazole (BTA), an emerging organic contaminant, to biochar in different electrolyte solutions were investigated. The results revealed the dual roles of DHA in BTA sorption to biochar. On the one hand, DHA can compete for sites and/or block pores available for BTA to inhibit the adsorption of BTA to biochar. On the other hand, the sorbed DHA on biochar can serve as additional partitioning phase to promote the partition of BTA. The finding was in accordance with the site energy distribution analysis of BTA sorption that the site energy of the highest occurring frequency in the DHA-BTA system was lower than that in the DHA-free system (3.41–10.4 versus 13.1–20.1 kJ mol−1). The variation in apparent BTA sorption to biochar affected by DHA was thus a combination of changes in both its partition and adsorption properties. A modified Dual-mode model including the aqueous concentration of DHA was proposed to predict the effect of DHA on BTA sorption to biochar in different electrolyte solutions, which showed good prediction performance with most BTA sorption coefficient (Kd, L g−1) deviations within 0.1 log unit.

TI  - Amending a tropical Arenosol: increasing shares of biochar and clay improve the nutrient sorption capacity
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 16
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Tropical Arenosols may be challenging for agricultural use, particularly in semi-arid regions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the addition of increasing shares of biochar and clay on the nutrient sorption capacity of a tropical Arenosol. In batch equilibrium experiments, the sorption of ammonium-N ($$\hbox {NH}_{4}^{+}{\text{-N}}$$), nitrate-N ($$\text {NO}_{3}^{-}{\text{-N}}$$), potassium ($$\text {K}^{+}$$), and phosphate-P ($$\text {PO}_{4}^{3-}{\text{-P}}$$) was quantified for mixtures of an Arenosol with increasing shares of biochar and clay (1%, 2.5%, 5%, 10%, 100%) and the unmixed Arenosol, biochar, and clay. The mid-temperature biochar was produced from Prosopis juliflora feedstock; the clayey material was taken from the sedimentary parent material of a temporarily dry lake. Only the Arenosol–biochar mixture with 10% biochar addition and the biochar increased the $$\text {NH}_{4}^{+}{\text{-N}}$$maximum sorption capacity ($$q_{max}$$) of the Arenosol, by 34% and 130%, respectively. The $$q_{max}$$of $$\text {PO}_{4}^{3-}{\text{-P}}$$slightly increased with ascending biochar shares (1–10%) by 14%, 30%, 26%, and 42%, whereas the undiluted biochar released $$\text {PO}_{4}^{3-}{\text{-P}}$$. Biochar addition slightly reduced $$\text {NO}_{3}^{-}{\text{-N}}$$release from the Arenosol but strongly induced $$\text {K}^{+}$$release. On the other hand, clay addition of 10% and clay itself augmented $$q_{max}$$of $$\text {NH}_{4}^{+}{\text{-N}}$$by 30% and 162%; ascending clay rates (1–100%) increased $$q_{max}$$for $$\text {PO}_{4}^{3-}{\text{-P}}$$by 78%, 130%, 180%, 268%, and 712%. Clay rates above 5% improved $$\text {K}^{+}$$sorption; however, no $$q_{max}$$values could be derived. Sorption of $$\text {NO}_{3}^{-}{\text{-N}}$$remained unaffected by clay amendment. Overall, clay addition proved to enhance the nutrient sorption capacity of the Arenosol more effectively than biochar; nonetheless, both materials may be promising amendments to meliorate sandy soils for agricultural use in the semi-arid tropics.

AB  - The mechanism of oxidation and degradation effect of phytate-modified biochar catalyzed persulfate on Ponceau 2R was investigated. Chemical-structural properties of phytate-modified biochar, such as surface morphology and surface oxygen-containing functional groups were characterized. The results suggest that modified biochar has better oxidation performance than unmodified biochar, and the modified biochar generated at 500 ℃ pyrolysis temperature can catalyze peroxymonosulfate (PMS) system with high efficiency, in large pH and temperature scope. And the degradation mechanism of Ponceau 2R by biochar-catalyzed PMS generation (BC-PMS) system was researched. It revealed that PBC300 (phytate-modified biochar pyrolyzed at 300 °C), PBC500 (phytate-modified biochar pyrolyzed at 500 °C), and PBC700 (phytate-modified biochar pyrolyzed at 700 °C) may have metaphosphoric acid linked to oxygen atoms and metaphosphoric acid linked in a bridging manner on the surface of biochar, catalyzing the production of hydroxyl radicals by PMS. PBC700 catalyzes the production of singlet oxygen by PMS through its structural defects, and singlet oxygen is the main catalytic product of PBC700.

TI  - Towards predicting biochar impacts on plant-available soil nitrogen content
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 9
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochars can improve soil health but have been widely shown to reduce plant-available nitrogen (N) owing to their high carbon (C) content, which stimulates microbial N-immobilization. However, because biochars contain large amounts of C that are not microbially available, their total elemental C:N ratio does not correspond well with impacts on soil N. We hypothesized that impacts on soil plant-available N would relate to biochar mineralizable-C (Cmin) content, and that C:N ratios of the mineralizable biochar component could provide a means for predicting conditions of net soil N-mineralization or -immobilization. We conducted two laboratory experiments, the first measuring biochar Cmin from respiration of isotopically labeled barley biochars manufactured at 300, 500, and 750 °C, and the second characterizing Cmin by proxy measurements for ten biochars from six feedstocks at several temperatures. For both experiments, soils were incubated with 2% biochar by mass to determine impacts to soil N-mineralization. Contrary to expectation, all the biochars increased soil N-mineralization relative to unamended soils. Also unexpected, higher temperature (500 and 700 °C) barley biochars with less Cmin stimulated more soil decomposition and more soil N-mineralization than a 350 °C barley biochar. However, across diverse biochar feedstocks and production methods, none of the biochar characteristics correlated with soil N-mineralization. The finding of improved soil N-mineralization adds complexity to the range of soil N responses that can be expected in response to biochar amendment. Because of the limited ability to predict soil N responses from biochar properties, users should monitor soil N to manage soil fertility.

TI  - Biochar applications influence soil physical and chemical properties, microbial diversity, and crop productivity: a meta-analysis
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 8
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar is a widely known soil amendment. Here we synthesize the available information on influence of biochar application on different soil properties and crop productivity using meta-analysis. Global data on influence of biochar applications on different soil physical, chemical, microbial properties, and crop productivity were extracted from literature and statistically analyzed. Based on selection criteria, 59 studies from the literature published between 2012 and 2021 were selected for the meta-analysis. Correlations were developed between effect size of biochar application on different soil properties and crop productivity. Application of biochar increased soil pH, cation exchange capacity, and organic carbon by 46%, 20%, and 27%, respectively, with greater effects in coarse and fine-textured soils. Effects on chemical properties were variable among biochar prepared from different feedstocks. Among physical properties, biochar application reduced bulk densities by 29% and increased porosity by 59%. Biochar prepared at higher pyrolytic temperatures (> 500 ℃) improved bulk density and porosity to greater extents (31% and 66%, respectively). Biochar prepared at lower pyrolytic temperatures (< 500 ℃) had a greater effect on microbial diversity (both bacterial and fungal), with more diverse bacterial populations in medium and coarse textured soils, while fungal diversity increased in fine textured soils. Biochar applications increased crop productivity only in fine and coarse textured soil. The effect size of biochar application on crop productivity was correlated with responses to physical properties of soils. The meta-analysis highlighted the need to conduct long-term field experiments to provide better explanations for changes in biochar properties as it undergoes aging, its longer-term effects on soil properties, and timing of re-application of different biochars.

JO  - Biochar

VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - As a metal immobilizer, biochar can be used to remediate contaminated soil. Biochar’s effect on the phytoremediation process in flooded conditions under a scenario of increasing flooding frequency as global climate change is not well understood. This study investigated bamboo biochar (BBC) effects on growth and metal accumulation of Salix in multi-metal contaminated soil under non-flooded versus flooded conditions. Salix cuttings were cultivated in pots with severely contaminated soil by Cd and Zn, for 120 days, with four treatments including non-flooded treatment, flooded treatment, non-flooded with 3% BBC application (BBC/soil, w/w), and flooded with 3% BBC addition. BBC, flooding, and BBC× flooding significantly decreased the bioavailability of metals in soils (P < 0.05). The BBC addition markedly stimulated Cd concentration in leaves under non-flooded (94.20%) and flooded conditions (32.73%) but showed little effect on roots. The BBC significantly boosted Cd and Zn transport from roots to aboveground parts by 68.85% and 102.27% compared with no BBC amendment under non-flooded treatment, while showing insignificant changes under flooded treatment. Although the plant biomass was little affected, BBC significantly increased Cd and Zn accumulation in the whole plant by 52.53% and 28.52% under non-flooded while showing an insignificant impact under flooded conditions. Taken together, BBC enhanced the phytoremediation efficiency of Salix to Cd and Zn in severely polluted non-flooded soil, while flooding offset this effect. The results indicated the effects of BBC varied under different soil moisture, which should be considered in the biochar-assisted phytoremediation to variable and complex environments.

AB  - In this study, four biochars prepared from different crop residue waste i.e. sugarcane bagasse (SBB), coconut shell (CNB), paddy straw (PDB), and distilled waste of lemongrass (LGB) were evaluated for removal of Remazol Brilliant Blue R from the aqueous system. The RBBR adsorption capacities of biochar were 97–79% for SBB, 99.9–99.47% for CNB, 66.1–48% for PDB, and 78–68% for LGB, dominantly controlled by their aromaticity and mineral content. The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms and pseudo-second-order kinetic models have described the chemisorption of RBBR on biochar surfaces. The thermodynamic data suggested that adsorption was spontaneous and endothermic. These biochars demonstrated excellent reusability (till four cycles with 50–61% regeneration). The purified water and biochar dye sludge demonstrated no phytotoxicity. The findings obtained in this study may provide supports for the potential of biochars for anionic dye removal from water and utilization of generated sludge for zero waste-producing technologies in the future.

TI  - Comparison of biochar properties from 5 kinds of halophyte produced by slow pyrolysis at 500 °C
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 12
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Glycophyte biomass-derived biochars are currently concerned in most studies. However, little attention is given to the characteristics of halophyte-derived biochars. In this study, five typical halophytes of euhalophytes (Suaeda altissima, Suaeda salsa, and Kalidium foliatum), recretohalophytes (Phragmites australis), and pseudohalophytes (Tamarix chinensis) which are widely distributed in the arid and semiarid regions of northwestern China were selected for producing biochars with a slow pyrolysis process at 500 °C for 1 h. The harvested biochars were characterized in elemental content, pores, surface area, and surface charges, and then their potential value as a soil conditioner was evaluated. The results showed that the halophyte-derived biochars had variable ash and Na+ contents, ranging from 7.26 to 23.64% and 1.06 to 33.93 g kg−1 respectively. The EC value of the biochars ranged from 1.76 to 23.45 mS cm−1. The biochar derived from Suaeda altissima had a very low specific surface area (SSA), 3.50 m2 g−1, while that derived from Phragmites australis (BPA) had a very high SSA, 344.02 m2 g−1. All the biochars carried both positive and negative charges. Kalidium foliatum biochar (BKF) possessed more negative charges, while Suaeda altissima biochar (BSA) contained more positive charges. In general, the halophyte biochars had a higher ash content and lower point of zero net charge (PZNC) value, compared with the biochars derived from glycophytes, which would imply their higher potential value as an acidic soil conditioner.

TI  - Effects of low molecular weight organic acids on aggregation behavior of biochar colloids at acid and neutral conditions
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 20
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs), as active components in the rhizosphere carbon cycling, may influence the environmental behaviors of biochar colloids. This study selected the pine-wood and wheat-straw biochars (PB and WB) as two typical biochars. The effects of typical LMWOAs (oxalic acid, citric acid, and malic acid) on aggregation kinetics of PB and WB colloids were investigated under pH 4 and 6 conditions. Critical coagulation concentrations (CCCs) of both PB and WB colloids were decreased with the LMWOAs regardless of the types of biochar and the solution pH, and the most significant effect occurred in pH 4 due to more LMWOAs sorption on the biochar colloids. The different types of LMWOAs caused various CCCs changes. For example, the CCC values of PB colloids decreased from 75 mM to 56, 52, and 47 mM in the pH 4 NaCl solutions when 1 mM oxalic acid, citric acid, and malic acid were present in the suspensions, respectively. The chemical structure (functional groups) and molecular weight of LMWOAs, solution pH, and the electrophoretic mobility (EPM) of biochar co-influence the interactions between biochar colloids and LMWOAs, thus affecting the stability of biochar colloids in the presence of LMWOAs. The presence of LMWOAs accelerated the aggregation of colloidal biochar by increasing the interaction of surface bridging bonds (hydrogen bonding) and decreasing the repulsive force between colloidal biochar particles. This study showed that LMWOAs could accelerate the aggregation of biochar colloids in acidic or neutral environments and reduce the mobility of biochar colloids in soil rhizosphere.

TI  - Impacts of temperatures and phosphoric-acid modification to the physicochemical properties of biochar for excellent sulfadiazine adsorption
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 14
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - The textural properties and surface chemistry of phosphoric acid-modified biochars (PABCs) prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures (500–700 °C) were studied based on the results obtained from XRD, SEM, BET, FT-IR, Raman, XPS and elements analyses. PABCs prepared at higher temperatures tended to possess a bigger proportion of microporous structure. The adsorption capacity and initial rate of PABCs for sulfadiazine (SDZ) were notably improved to 139.2 mg/g and 9.66 mg/(g min) as calculated from the Langmuir model. The adsorption equilibrium time was only one quarter of that without modification. The H3PO4 modification was advantageous to produce phosphate and break functional groups to form disordered carbon structure abundant of micropores. The enhancement in the adsorption of SDZ was due to the confinement effect of hydrophobic cavities from the mircoporous structure and the π–π electron–donor–acceptor interaction. Specially, PABCs exhibited stable adsorption capacities at a wide pH range (3.0–9.0) or relatively high concentrations of coexisting ions.

TI  - Life cycle assessment of urban uses of biochar and case study in Uppsala, Sweden
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 18
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar is a material derived from biomass pyrolysis that is used in urban applications. The environmental impacts of new biochar products have however not been assessed. Here, the life cycle assessments of 5 biochar products (tree planting, green roofs, landscaping soil, charcrete, and biofilm carrier) were performed for 7 biochar supply-chains in 2 energy contexts. The biochar products were benchmarked against reference products and oxidative use of biochar for steel production. Biochar demand was then estimated, using dynamic material flow analysis, for a new city district in Uppsala, Sweden. In a decarbonised energy system and with high biochar stability, all biochar products showed better climate performance than the reference products, and most applications outperformed biomass use for decarbonising steel production. The climate benefits of using biochar ranged from − 1.4 to − 0.11 tonne CO2-eq tonne−1 biochar in a decarbonised energy system. In other environmental impact categories, biochar products had either higher or lower impacts than the reference products, depending on biochar supply chain and material substituted, with trade-offs between sectors and impact categories. However, several use-phase effects of biochar were not included in the assessment due to knowledge limitations. In Uppsala’s new district, estimated biochar demand was around 1700 m3 year−1 during the 25 years of construction. By 2100, 23% of this biochar accumulated in landfill, raising questions about end-of-life management of biochar-containing products. Overall, in a post-fossil economy, biochar can be a carbon dioxide removal technology with benefits, but biochar applications must be designed to maximise co-benefits.

TI  - Nitrogen-doped biochars as adsorbents for mitigation of heavy metals and organics from water: a review
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 17
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Mitigation of toxic contaminants from wastewater is crucial to the safety and sustainability of the aquatic ecosystem and human health. There is a pressing need to find economical and efficient technologies for municipal, agricultural, aquacultural, and industrial wastewater treatment. Nitrogen-doped biochar, which is synthesized from waste biomass, is shown to exhibit good adsorptive performance towards harmful aqueous contaminants, including heavy metals and organic chemicals. Incorporating nitrogen into the biochar matrix changes the overall electronic structure of biochar, which favors the interaction of N-doped biochar with contaminants. In this review, we start the discussion with the preparation techniques and raw materials used for the production of N-doped biochar, along with its structural attributes. Next, the adsorption of heavy metals and organic pollutants on N-doped biochars is systematically discussed. The adsorption mechanisms of contaminant removal by N-doped biochar are also clearly explained. Further, mathematical analyses of adsorption, crucial to the quantification of adsorption, process design, and understanding of the mechanics of the process, are reviewed. Furthermore, the influence of environmental parameters on the adsorption process and the reusability of N-doped biochars are critically evaluated. Finally, future research trends for the design and development of application-specific preparation of N-doped biochars for wastewater treatment are suggested.

TI  - Biochar for the removal of contaminants from soil and water: a review
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 19
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar shows significant potential to serve as a globally applicable material to remediate water and soil owing to the extensive availability of feedstocks and conducive physio-chemical surface characteristics. This review aims to highlight biochar production technologies, characteristics of biochar, and the latest advancements in immobilizing and eliminating heavy metal ions and organic pollutants in soil and water. Pyrolysis temperature, heat transfer rate, residence time, and type of feedstock are critical influential parameters. Biochar’s efficacy in managing contaminants relies on the pore size distribution, surface groups, and ion-exchange capacity. The molecular composition and physical architecture of biochar may be crucial when practically applied to water and soil. In general, biochar produced at relatively high pyrolysis temperatures can effectively manage organic pollutants via increasing surface area, hydrophobicity and microporosity. Biochar generated at lower temperatures is deemed to be more suitable for removing polar organic and inorganic pollutants through oxygen-containing functional groups, precipitation and electrostatic attraction. This review also presents the existing obstacles and future research direction related to biochar-based materials in immobilizing organic contaminants and heavy metal ions in effluents and soil.

TI  - Ball-milled bismuth oxychloride/biochar nanocomposites with rich oxygen vacancies for reactive red-120 adsorption in aqueous solution
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 21
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Fabricating surface oxygen vacancies is considered to be an efficient method to improve the adsorption performance of sorbents. In this work, a bismuth oxychloride/biochar (BiOCl/BC) nanocomposite with abundant oxygen vacancies was successfully prepared by a facile ball milling method. BiOCl/BC nanocomposite was found to have excellent adsorption performance for removing reactive red-120 (RR120) from aqueous solution. The effects of key adsorption parameters, such as RR120 dye concentration, solution pH (2–10), and contact time were studied by batch adsorption test. The adsorption data were well described by the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. The 50%-BiOCl/BC (50 wt% of BiOCl in composite) exhibited the best adsorptive performance (60%), much better than the pristine BM-BC (20%). The high adsorption capacity of 50%-BiOCl/BC (Langmuir maximum capacity of 116.382 mg g−1) can be attributed to the electrostatic effect, π–π interactions, and hydrogen bond. This work provided a facile method to prepare semiconductor assisted biochar-based adsorbents, which would also contribute to the advance of environmental remediation.

TI  - A perspective on biochar for repairing damages in the soil–plant system caused by climate change-driven extreme weather events
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 22
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - There has been more than 75% rise in the number of extreme weather events such as drought and flood during 2000–2019 compared to 1980–1999 due to the adverse effects of climate change, causing significant deterioration of the soil and water quality. Simultaneously, the growing human population has been exerting pressure on available water and soil resources due to overuse or unplanned use. While greenhouse gas emissions have intensified, the fertility of agricultural soils has declined globally due to the exposure of soils to frequent flooding, desertification, and salinization (resulting from extreme weather events). The current review aims to give an overview of damages caused to the soil–plant system by extreme weather events and provide a perspective on how biochar can repair the damaged system. Biochar is known to improve soil fertility, increase crop productivity and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions via sustainable recycling of bio-waste. Beneficial properties of biochar such as alkaline pH, high cation exchange capacity, abundant surface functional groups, remarkable surface area, adequate porosity, excellent water holding capacity, and sufficient nutrient retention capacity can help repair the adverse effects of extreme weather events in the soil–plant system. This paper recommends some cautious future approaches that can propel biochar’s use in improving the soil–plant systems and promoting sustainable functioning of extreme weather-affected areas via mitigation of the adverse effects.

TI  - Removal of toxic elements from aqueous environments using nano zero-valent iron- and iron oxide-modified biochar: a review
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 24
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar (BC) has gained attention for removal of toxic elements (TEs) from aqueous media; however, pristine biochar often exhibits low adsorption capability. Thus, various modification strategies in BC have been developed to improve its removal capability against TEs. Nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) and iron oxides (FeOx) have been used as sorbents for TE removal. However, these materials are prone to agglomeration and also expensive, which make their usage limited for large-scale applications. The nZVI technical demerits could be resolved by the development of BC-based composite sorbents through the loading of nZVI or FeOx onto BC surface. Nano zero-valent iron modified BC (nZVIBC), FeOx-modified BC (FeOxBC) have attracted attention for their capability in removing pollutants from the aqueous phases. Nonetheless, a potential use of nZVIBC and FeOxBC for TE removal from aqueous environments has not been well-realized or reviewed. As such, this article reviews: (i) the preparation and characterization of nZVIBC and FeOxBC; (ii) the capacity of nZVIBC and FeOxBC for TE retention in line with their physicochemical properties, and (iii) TE removal mechanisms by nZVIBC and FeOxBC. Adopting nZVI and FeOx in BC increases its sporptive capability of TEs due to surface modifications in morphology, functional groups, and elemental composition. The combined effects of BC and nZVI, FeOx or Fe salts on the sorption of TEs are complex because they are very specific to TEs. This review identified significant opportunities for research and technology advancement of nZVIBC and FeOxBC as novel and effective sorbents for the remediation of TEs contaminated water.

TI  - Analysis of the simultaneous adsorption mechanism of ammonium and phosphate on magnesium-modified biochar and the slow release effect of fertiliser
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 25
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - To decrease the eutrophication caused by nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in water, magnesium-modified corn stalk biochar (MgB) was prepared under the synergistic impact of the multi-pyrolysis temperatures and Mg2+ contents for the co-adsorption of ammonium (NH4+-N) and phosphate (PO43−). The co-adsorption mechanism, slow-release performance and plant application of MgB were systematically studied. The results showed that pyrolysis temperatures (350–650 °C) and Mg2+(0–3.6 g/L) contents not only altered the physicochemical properties of biochar, but also significantly affected the adsorption efficacy of MgB. The adsorption of NH4+-N and PO43− was in accordance with Langmuir–Freundlich and pseudo-second-order kinetic models (Qmax = 37.72 and 73.29 mg/g, respectively). Based on the characteristics, adsorption kinetics and isotherms results, the adsorption mechanism was determined and found to mainly involve struvite precipitation, ion exchange, and surface precipitation or electrostatic attraction. Compared with the leaching performance of chemical fertilizers (CF), after adsorption of NH4+-N and PO43− (MgB-A), MgB had a more stable pH and lower conductivity. Leaching of NH4+-N and PO43− by MgB-A was controlled by both the diffusion mechanism and the dissolution rate of struvite and Mg-P. The excellent long-term slow-release performance and abundant Mg2+ of MgB-A promoted the growth of Zea mays L. and Lolium perenne L. Overall, this study suggested that MgB could realize a win–win outcome of struvite biochar-based fertiliser production and wastewater treatment.

TI  - Biogas residue biochar integrated with phosphate from its ash for the effective recovery of nutrients from piggery biogas slurry
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 23
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) precipitation generally requires an external phosphorus source to increase the recovery of NH4+-N from biogas slurry. However, P-rich piggery biogas residue has been ignored as a phosphorus source. In this study, biogas residue was carbonized into biogas residue biochar (BRC), followed by acid leaching to synthesize functionalized BRC and release PO43−-P from its ash as the phosphorus source. The effects of different acids on the leaching efficiency and morphological changes of P in BRC were investigated, and NH4+-N and PO43−-P in the biogas slurry were recovered with functionalized BRC and MAP precipitation. The results showed that oxalic acid-hydrochloric acid mixed acid could leach more than 96% of P in BRC, while weakening the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ on MAP precipitation. The BRC was mainly composed of inorganic P, and most nonapatite IP and apatite P (Ca3(PO4)2) were leached during acid leaching, with the latter more easily leached. Under optimal recovery conditions, the method had a significant recovery effect on NH4+-N (96.4%) and PO43−-P (99.3%) in biogas slurry. The recovery of NH4+-N and PO43−-P by functionalized BRC was mainly through chemical precipitation (forming NH4MgPO4·H2O precipitate) while bonding with -OH, C = O and C-H functional groups. The final recovery product was also a BRC-based slow-release N-P fertilizer rich in struvite. This study solved the disposal problems of P-rich biogas residue and N-rich biogas slurry while providing an innovative technology for the resource utilization of faecal sewage at pig farms.

AB  - Nanoparticles are abundant in the subsurface, soil, streams, and water bodies, and are often a critical control on elemental speciation, transport and cycling in the natural environment. This review provides an overview of pyrolyzed biomass-derived nanoparticles (PBNPs), their surface properties and reactivity towards aqueous species. We focus specifically on biochar-derived nanoparticles and activated carbon-derived nanoparticles which fall under our classification of PBNPs. Activated carbon-iron (nano)composites are included in some instances where there are significant gaps in literature because of their environmental relevance. Increased use of activated carbon, along with a resurgence in the manufacture and application of biochar for water treatment and soil amendment, has generated significant concerns about the mobility and toxicity of PBNPs derived from the bulk material in environmental applications. Recent examples are discussed to highlight current progress in understanding the influence of PBNPs on contaminant transport, followed by a critical discussion of gaps and future research directions.

TI  - Bamboo charcoal fused with polyurethane foam for efficiently removing organic solvents from wastewater: experimental and simulation
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 28
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - The development of a multifunctional oil adsorbing material which could effectively and quickly separate oily wastewater is one of the focuses in water environment restoration. In this study, bamboo charcoal (BC) was used as an improver to modify polyurethane (PU) foam. The results of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed that the addition of BC could effectively improve the mechanical properties of PU. The adsorption data exhibited that the BC-loaded PU (BC/PU) foam composites effectively removed seven organic solvents (OSs, including octane, petroleum ether, soybean oil, chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichloroethane, n-hexane, cyclohexane), and the maximum adsorption capacity of BC/PU was 23.6 g g−1 when BC content was 5%. The order of pseudo-second-order kinetic constants and maximum adsorption capacity of seven OSs was octane < petroleum ether < soybean oil < chlorobenzene < 1, 2-dichloroethane < cyclohexane < n-hexane. Based on the experimental data and density functional theory (DFT) simulation, the adsorption mechanism of OSs on BC/PU-5 was discussed. The EHOMO and μ of OSs calculated by DFT were highly correlated with absorption affinity (K2, Qe and Qmax). Hence, the contribution of OSs to the adsorption efficiency of BC/PU-5 may be mainly due to electron donor–acceptor (EDA) interaction and non-hydrophobic interaction. In addition, the adsorption capacity did not change significantly after repeated recycling 5 times. Overall, the prepared BC/PU foam composites could be used as a potential candidate for separating OSs in engineering applications.

VL  - 4

AB  - The hydroxyapatite-loaded swine manure derived-biocarbon was successfully prepared by pyrolysis method for the adsorption of uranium(VI). The results of the adsorption experiments displayed that the adsorption behaviors for uranium(VI) of biocarbon did almost not depend on the interfering ions except Al3+, Ca2+ and CO32−, showing the high selectivity of the composites for uranium(VI). The maximum static and dynamic removal capacity of the hydroxyapatite-biocarbon composites to uranium(VI) were 834.8 and 782.8 mg/g (pH = 3, m/V = 0.1 g/L and T = 298 K), far exceeding other reported biocarbon and hydroxyapatite materials, which indicated that the hydroxyapatite-biocarbon composites possessed an application potential in adsorption. After five cycles of adsorption–desorption processes, the removal efficiency of the hydroxyapatite-biocarbon composite for uranium(VI) was 93.2% (Ci = 5 mg/L, pH = 3, m/V = 0.1 g/L and T = 298 K), revealing that the composite had excellent stability and reusability. Moreover, the capture mechanisms of the hydroxyapatite-biocarbon composite for uranium(VI) included ion exchange and complexation, which was ascribed to the ample active adsorption sites (–OH and PO43−). Therefore, the hydroxyapatite-loaded swine manure derived-biocarbon would be a potential material to effectually separate uranium(VI) from solution.

AB  - Metal-free photocatalysts have attracted growing concern recently. Herein, the composites combining g-C3N4 with wood pulp cellulose biochar (WPBC/g-C3N4) were synthesized to effectively activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) under visible light for the degradation of diclofenac (DCF). The incorporation of WPBC endowed g-C3N4 with enhanced visible light absorption, improved charge separation capability, reduced electrical conductivity, and increased photocatalytic and PMS activation capability. Based on quenching tests, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), electrochemical analysis and solvent exchange experiments, both radical and nonradical mechanisms were proposed. Radical species including ·OH, h+, ·O2– were identified to contribute to DCF degradation. The 1O2 and electron transfer were the dominant nonradical pathways for DCF degradation. Moreover, the common influencing factors were examined, and DCF concentration was the most influential factor based on principal component analysis. Generally, the composites exhibited good reusability during consecutive runs. Based on HPLC/MS analysis, four intermediates were detected and the possible DCF degradation pathway was proposed. This work provided a potential strategy based on metal-free WPBC/g-C3N4 for the photocatalytic activation of PMS to effectively degrade emerging contaminants in wastewater.

TI  - Removal performance, mechanisms, and influencing factors of biochar for air pollutants: a critical review
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 30
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - The emission of air pollutants from various industries is a major contributor to environmental pollution. The removal of these pollutants before they are discharged into the environment has become an important means of controlling air pollution. Biochar has attracted increasing attention because of its low cost, high porosity, large specific surface area, abundant surface functional groups, and high removal capacity. The physicochemical properties of biochar are greatly affected by feedstock types, preparation, and modification conditions. For this reason, the capacity and propensity of biochar for removing air pollutants are rather variable. To understand the existing research status and grasp the latest research progress, a systematic review on the removal of different air pollutants by biochar is highly needed. Based on the recent research, this paper systematically analyzes and summarizes the preparation and modification methods of biochar commonly used for the removal of six air pollutants (SO2, H2S, CO2, Hg0, VOCs, and NH3), as well as the removal performance and mechanisms. Then, the potential influencing factors (preparation parameters, physicochemical characteristics of biochar, and removal conditions) are discussed. Finally, the regeneration of biochar, suggestions, and future perspectives are proposed.

TI  - Sorption kinetics of 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene to biochars produced at various temperatures
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 32
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Sorption kinetics of organic compounds on biochars is important for understanding the retardation of mobility and bioavailability of organic compounds. Herein, sorption kinetics of 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene on biochars prepared from 200 to 700 °C was investigated to explore the sorption process. Loose partition matrix and condensed partition matrix were formed at relatively low and moderate temperatures, respectively. However, biochars produced at relatively high temperatures formed rich pore structures. Therefore, sorption equilibrium time of 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene increased with increasing preparation temperature from 200 to 350 °C due to the slower diffusion rate in the more condensed matrix, and then decreased when preparation temperature was higher than 400 °C because of the faster adsorption rate in the greater number of pores. Linear positive relationship between matrix diffusion rates of 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene on biochars prepared at 200, 250, 300, 350 °C and H/C ratios of biochars was observed, suggesting that the inhibition of partition process was caused by the condensed matrix in biochars. Linear positive relationships between adsorption rates (i.e., fast outer diffusion rate and slow pore diffusion rate) of 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene on biochars prepared at 400, 450, 550, 700 °C and graphite defects of biochars were observed, because the increase of graphite defects of biochars could promote the adsorption by increasing the quantity of fast diffusion channels and sorption sites. This study reveals the underlying mechanisms of sorption kinetics for organic compounds with relatively large size on biochars, which has potential guidance for the application of biochars and prediction of the environmental risks of organic compounds.

TI  - p-Arsanilic acid decontamination over a wide pH range using biochar-supported manganese ferrite material as an effective persulfate catalyst: Performances and mechanisms
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 31
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Direct chemical oxidation and pure adsorption could not effectively remove p-Arsanilic acid (p-ASA) and the released inorganic arsenic. Herein, one novel biochar supported MnFe2O4 (MFB) was synthesized and adopted for p-ASA degradation and synchronous adsorption of the generated inorganic arsenic. The MFB/persulfate (PS) system could remain effective under a wide pH range (3.0–9.0), and the released arsenic could be removed simultaneously by MFB. Mechanism investigation revealed that the functional groups of MFB (i.e. O–C=O and C=O), Fe and Mn oxides on MFB all contributed to PS activation. O2·− and 1O2 were the main reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for p-ASA degradation, and 1O2 was the predominant ROS. Besides, the MFB  possessed superior reusability. Therefore, it is expected to develop a potential method for organic arsenic contaminants removal via an oxidation-adsorption process, and the results could also shed light on the better understanding of the PS activation mechanisms.

TI  - Unraveling natural aging-induced properties change of sludge-derived hydrochar and enhanced cadmium sorption site heterogeneity
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 34
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Hydrochar has potential applications in soil improvement and heavy metal remediation. Hydrochar would undergo the process of aging when introduced into the soil, altering its properties. However, recent studies have focused mainly on the artificial aging of hydrochar, which could not reveal the cumulative effect of multiple environmental factors. Therefore, the periodical monitoring of the property and sorption behavior of hydrochar after amending soils is necessary to better understand the multifaceted mechanisms associated with the natural aging of hydrochar. This study selected the sludge-derived hydrochar (SLHC) as a typical hydrochar and applied a 16-month rice–wheat–rice rotation to mimic the natural aging of hydrochar, focusing on changing properties and cadmium (Cd) sorption and literature contrast between aging strategies and biochar types. The porosity, O abundance, and ash content of 16-month aged SLHC increased by 37%, 47%, and 8.5%, respectively, facilitating Cd sorption due to surface complexation, pore sorption, and precipitation. The sorption percentage of Cd to SLHC was in the range of 11–14% for SLHC-A0 and increased to 17–31% for SLHC-A4 and 20–32% for SLHC-A16 after natural aging. The natural aging of SLHC induced by ash content played an essential role in Cd sorption site heterogeneity. Linear regression analysis showed that aging strategies on sorption behavior significantly differed between biochars. Thus, studies involving natural aging with multiple environmental factors are preferred over those involving chemical or biological aging. Future studies should continue to explore the mechanisms of natural aging-induced heavy metal sorption between hydrochar and pyrochar. These results improve insights to appraise the potential of SLHC as soil amendments to alleviate the adverse effects of heavy metal contamination and provide an essential basis for researchers and staff in soil management and environmental prevention.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 36
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Globally, nitrogen (N) fertilizer demand is expected to reach 112 million tonnes to support food production for about 8 billion people. However, more than half of the N fertilizer is lost to the environment with impacts on air, water and soil quality, and biodiversity. Importantly, N loss to the environment contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Nevertheless, where N fertilizer application is limited, severe depletion of soil fertility has become a major constraint to sustainable agriculture. To address the issues of low fertilizer N use efficiency (NUE), biochar-based N fertilizers (BBNFs) have been developed to reduce off-site loss and maximize crop N uptake. These products are generally made through physical mixing of biochar and N fertilizer or via coating chemical N fertilizers such as prilled urea with biochar. This review aims to describe the manufacturing processes of BBNFs, and to critically assess the effects of the products on soil properties, crop yield and N loss pathways.

TI  - Insights into simultaneous adsorption and oxidation of antimonite [Sb(III)] by crawfish shell-derived biochar: spectroscopic investigation and theoretical calculations
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 37
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Removal of antimonite [Sb(III)] from the aquatic environment and reducing its biotoxicity is urgently needed to safeguard environmental and human health. Herein, crawfish shell-derived biochars (CSB), pyrolyzed at 350, 500, and 650°C, were used to remediate Sb(III) in aqueous solutions. The adsorption data best fitted to the pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models. Biochar produced at 350°C (CSB350) showed the highest adsorption capacity (27.7 mg g− 1), and the maximum 78% oxidative conversion of Sb(III) to Sb(V). The adsorption results complemented with infrared (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron (XPS), and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy analyses indicated that the adsorption of Sb(III) on CSB involved electrostatic interaction, surface complexation with oxygen-containing functional groups (C = O, O = C–O), π–π coordination with aromatic C = C and C–H groups, and H-bonding with –OH group. Density functional theory calculations verified that surface complexation was the most dominant adsorption mechanism, whilst π–π coordination and H-bonding played a secondary role. Furthermore, electron spin resonance (ESR) and mediated electrochemical reduction/oxidation (MER/MEO) analyses confirmed that Sb(III) oxidation at the biochar surface was governed by persistent free radicals (PFRs) (•O2− and •OH) and the electron donating/accepting capacity (EDC/EAC) of biochar. The abundance of preferable surface functional groups, high concentration of PFRs, and high EDC conferred CSB350 the property of an optimal adsorbent/oxidant for Sb(III) removal from water. The encouraging results of this study call for future trials to apply suitable biochar for removing Sb(III) from wastewater at pilot scale and optimize the process.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 38
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - As cheap and renewable sources, the exploitation of biomass resources was of great value in phase change energy storage. In this study, hemp stems were converted into biochars with three-dimensional multi-level anisotropic pores through a temperature-controlled charring process, which were used as supports for polyethylene glycol (PEG6000) to form shape-stable composite phase change materials (ss-CPCMs). It is shown that the ss-CPCMs using anisotropic hemp-stem-derived biochar obtained at a carbonization temperature of 900 °C  as a support has high PEG6000 loading rate (88.62wt%), large latent heat (170.44 J/g) and favorable thermal stability owning to its high surface area and hierarchical pores. The biochar-based ss-CPCM also has good light absorption ability with a maximum solar-thermal conversion efficiency of 97.70%. In addition, the different thermal conductivities in the transverse and longitudinal directions of ss-CPCMs reflect the unique anisotropic structure. This work can not only improve the high-value utilization of biochars, but also provide the ss-CPCMs with excellent performance for solar-thermal conversion and storage systems.

TI  - Biochar aerogel-based electrocatalyst towards efficient oxygen evolution in acidic media
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 39
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - The controllable synthesis of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst is an urgent need to advance the development of sustainable energy conversion and storage. However, the OER efficiency in acidic media is seriously hindered by slow reaction kinetics. The traditional acidic OER electrocatalysts are more prone to be oxidized and corroded as results of unstable carrier structures and variable electronic states of active species. Herein, a high-performing biochar aerogel (BA) based electrocatalyst were realistically designed and synthetized via joint utilization of the terrestrial lignin and seaweed polysaccharide as carbon sources.  Originating from the induction effect of "egg-box" structure in alginate and the self-template effect of lignosulfonate, the BA decorated with Ru/RuS2 particles was synthesized triumphantly. The as-synthesized electrocatalyst required a low overpotential of 228 mV to attain 10 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and exhibited a good stability for over 12,000 s. The good activity was strongly dependent on the assembled unique two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D/3D) channels in carbon aerogels. Notably, the numerous defective sites at carbon could strongly interact with the Ru/RuS2 heterojunction for remarkably enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of whole catalytic system in acidic media. This work puts  forward a novel and effective strategy towards the enhancement of the acidic OER process by rational regulations of the BA and the coupling effect in micro-interface.

TI  - A quantitative evaluation of the biochar’s influence on plant disease suppress: a global meta-analysis
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 43
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Numerous studies have demonstrated that soil applications of biochar contribute to plant disease suppression and growth promotion. Here, we quantitatively evaluated the performance of biochars on plant disease suppression and production using meta-analysis of literature data. The results indicated that biochar amendment dramatically reduced disease severity (DS) by 47.46% while increasing plant biomass by 44.05%. The highest disease suppression was achieved with soil application of straw-derived biochar compared to biochar from other feedstocks, while no significant increase in yield was found with straw-derived biochar. Biochars pyrolyzed at medium temperatures (350–600 °C) facilitate both disease controlling and growth promotion. Soil application of biochars between 3 and 5% significantly decreased plant DS by 59.11%, and inverted U-shaped biochar dose/DS suppression curve and biochar dose/growth curve were observed. In cash crop fields, the DS of plants amended with biochar was reduced over 50%, which was  significantly higher than that of grain crops and perennial trees. Furthermore, biochar performance on plant disease suppression was higher for airborne pathogens than for soilborne pathogens, possibly due to the systemic activation of plant defences by biochar amendment. Additionally, a reduction of DS by biochar was observed on plants grown in agricultural soils. Our work contributes to the standardization of biochar production and provides a reference for improving the function of biochar in disease control.

TI  - A nanoscale observation to explain the discrepancy of electron exchange capacities between biochar containing comparable surface redox-active moieties
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 41
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar, possessing electron exchange capacities (EEC), is generally involved in environmental redox reactions due to the presence of redox-active moieties (RAMs). The phenomenon that chars containing comparable RAMs possess differential EEC revealed that the accessibility of RAMs is important to the redox properties. However, many studies have focused on the type of RAMs, whereas the distribution has been insufficiently investigated. Herein, we achieved nanoscale observation of electroactive moieties on the surface of six chars using a conductive atomic force microscope. For the two specific kinds of chars with submicron particles and opposite current distributions, the submicron particles took up only 1–4‰wt of biochar accounting for approximately 30–50% of electron-donating capacity (EDC), and electron-accepting capacity (EAC) became 87% and 1.40 times as before after removing submicron particles, respectively. Meanwhile, the combined impact of RAMs and surface topography (that uneven distribution of RAMs resulted in outstanding EEC by enhancing accessibility) was clarified. Furthermore, direct evidence of the link between char structure and EEC (that condensed aromatic structures were indispensable to EAC while both heteroatoms and amorphous aromatics contributed to EDC) was established. These findings can aid in understanding the functions of biochar in biotic and abiotic redox processes.

TI  - Biochar amendment alters the partitioning of nitrate reduction by significantly enhancing DNRA in a paddy field
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 44
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Using 15N tracer technique, we investigated the potential rates of denitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), and their partitioning among nitrate reduction, as well as the N2O emission rates in a paddy soil receiving various biochar (0%, 0.03%, 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1.0%; w/w) and straw (0.1%) over six consecutive years. Results showed that except for the 1.0% amendment treatment, biochar significantly (P < 0.05) increased denitrification rates by 10.19‒75.96% compared with non-biochar amended treatment, and that  biochar significantly (P < 0.05) increased DNRA rates by 1.63‒6.84 folds relative to non-biochar amended treatment. Consequently, biochar shifted more NO3– partitioning toward DNRA process, as suggested by the increased DNRA/(denitrification + DNRA) ratios from 1.60 to 13.18%. On the other hand, biochar significantly (P < 0.05) reduced N2O emission rates by 61.86–97.65% accompanied by a significant decrease in N2O/(N2O + N2) ratios (65.29–98.39%), indicating biochar amendment facilitated the reduction of N2O to N2. The promoting effects of biochar on DNRA rates and DNRA/(denitrification + DNRA) ratios were attributed to the increased carbon availability and the altered nitrate reducer communities. Collectively, our study suggests that biochar amendment in the paddy soil is helpful for N conservation by favoring nitrate partitioning toward DNRA process, which deepens our understanding of how biochar mediates N cycling in the paddy field.

JO  - Biochar

VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar and dung amendments have been extensively employed in soil remediation and fertilization of grasslands, which are the largest terrestrial sinks for methane. However, how these exogenous amendments regulate methane metabolisms at the molecular and community levels remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the functional genes and community assemblies of methanogens and methanotrophs using Geochip 5.0 and high-throughput sequencing to reveal the impacts of biochar and dung on soil methanogenesis and methane oxidation. The interactions between methane metabolic genes and other biogeochemical genes were also examined. According to Geochip microarrays, methanogenic gene mcrA decreased and increased with dung or biochar amendment, respectively; The methanotrophic gene pmoA showed a reverse but not significant tendency. Undominated processes contributed 65.51% to replace homogeneous selections as primary driving forces of methanogen assembly after dung amendment; the contribution of dispersal limitation increased to 46.13% in methanotroph assembly after biochar amendment. The diversity and association of co-occurrence networks for carbon–nitrogen cycling genes decreased after exogenous amendments. These results indicated that biochar and dung amendments prominently regulated the functional genes and community assembly involved in methane metabolisms. The co-existence patterns of methane metabolic genes and other related geochemical genes were also shaped by these amendments. This study provides the scientific reference for the development of grassland management in the context of global warming.

TI  - Biochar and organic substitution improved net ecosystem economic benefit in intensive vegetable production
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 46
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar amendment and substituting chemical fertilizers with organic manure (organic substitution) have been widely reported to increase crop production and decrease reactive nitrogen (Nr) loss including nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), and ammonia (NH3) emissions, and N runoff and leaching. However, few comprehensive evaluations have been performed on the environmental and economic aspects of biochar amendment or organic substitution. Here, we studied the comprehensive effects of biochar amendment, organic substitution, and biochar amendment combined with organic substitution on crop production, Nr loss, and net ecosystem economic benefit (NEEB) in intensive vegetable production by integrating life-cycle assessment for Nr footprints, empirical models for NH3 volatilization and N runoff and leaching derived from peer-reviewed publications and validated by the current measurements and direct field measurement for N2O and NO emissions during 5 consecutive years of vegetable crop rotations. Five fertilization treatments were applied (SN: synthetic fertilizer application; SNB: SN plus 20 t ha−1 biochar amendment; SNM: substituting 50% of chemical N fertilizer with organic manure; SNMB: SNM plus 20 t ha−1 biochar amendment; and CK: no fertilizer or biochar addition). Compared with the SN, the SNB increased vegetable yield (28.4%, p < 0.05; interannually varying from − 10 to 74.9%) and nitrogen use efficiency (29.2%, interannually varying from − 39.7 to 150.4%), and decreased field Nr loss (45.4%, p < 0.01; interannually varying from − 40.3 to 78.4%), and thus improved NEEB by 7.1%; meanwhile, the SNM increased vegetable yield (11.6%, interannually varying from − 5.4 to 27.1%) and nitrogen use efficiency (45.7%, p < 0.05; interannually varying from 2.3 to 154%), reduced field Nr loss (34.9%, p < 0.01; interannually varying from 8.4–39.0%), and thus improved NEEB by 17.8% (p < 0.05) compared to the SN, being 56.0 × 103 Chinese Yuan (CNY) ha−1 crop−1. Due to the high foreground Nr loss during organic manure production and high input costs of biochar production, the SNMB decreased the NEEB by 8.0% as compared to the SN. Moreover, the SNB and SNM improved vegetable qualities by increasing protein, soluble sugar, and vitamin C contents while decreasing nitrate content (p < 0.05). Therefore, single application of biochar amendment or organic substitution would achieve better NEEB and product quality in vegetable production.

TI  - Advances in preparation, application in contaminant removal, and environmental risks of biochar-based catalysts: a review
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 51
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - As a carbon-rich material produced by pyrolysis of biomass, biochar features low cost, large specific surface area, and widely available feedstocks based on the functional diversity and environmental-friendly properties, it has received increasing attention in the fields of pollutant removal due to three win–win effects of water remediation, carbon sequestration and reutilization of wastes. To design excellent biochar-based catalysts for environmental applications, one must understand recent advances in the catalysts for contaminant removal. This review focuses on the current application of biochar-based catalysts in redox systems, Fenton-like systems, sonocatalytic systems and photocatalytic systems. Besides in-depth discussion in effects of preparation conditions on physicochemical characteristics of biochars, the review supplements new preparation technologies of biochar and biochar-based catalysts. Most importantly, the advantages/shortcomings, catalysis mechanisms, as well as the pollutant removal ability of  different types of biochar-based catalysts are discussed. The environmental risks of the catalyst applications are also elaborated on. Future research on biochar-based catalyst production and its environmental applications is discussed. The review provides a good overview of the current advances of biochar-based catalysts in pollutant control and the futureresearch directions.

TI  - Weak-acid biochar catalyst prepared from mechanochemically-activated biomass and humic acid for production of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 42
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Many types of sustainably-prepared functional biochar catalysts are needed to transform biomass substrates into platform chemicals. In this work, weak-acid biochar catalysts were prepared by mix ball-milled (10 min, isothermal, room temperature) cherry blossom tree leaf biomass (BM) with humic acid (H) prior to carbonization of samples for 1 h under nitrogen gas. Characterization of the as-prepared materials (HBM-carbonization temperature in °C) showed that humic acid activated the biochars and increased their number of oxygen-containing functional (–COOH, OH) groups. The weak-acid biochars were applied as heterogeneous catalysts for dehydration of fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), where it was found that biochar catalyst, HBM-400, gave 100% fructose conversion and 77.5% 5-HMF yields in an ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride) reaction system (140 °C, 60 min reaction time). As-prepared HBM-400 biochars exhibited constant catalytic activity for fructose dehydration with repeated use without any type of reactivation treatment and were stable for 5 cycles. Humic acid is an effective additive for preparing weak-acid catalytic materials from waste biomass.

TI  - Preparation and characterization of MgO hybrid biochar and its mechanism for high efficient recovery of phosphorus from aqueous media
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 40
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Conversion of organic waste into engineered metal-biochar composite is an effective way of enhancing biochar’s efficiency for adsorptive capture of phosphorus (P) from aqueous media. Thus, various strategies have been created for the production of metal-biochar composites; however, the complex preparation steps, high-cost metal salt reagent application, or extreme process equipment requirements involved in those strategies limited the large-scale production of metal-biochar composites. In this study, a novel biochar composite rich in magnesium oxides (MFBC) was directly produced through co-pyrolysis of magnesite with food waste; the product, MFBC was used to adsorptively capture P from solution and bio-liquid wastewater. The results showed that compared to the pristine food waste biochar, MFBC was a uniformly hybrid MgO biochar composite with a P capture capacity of 523.91 mg/g. The capture of P by MFBC was fitted using the Langmuir and pseudo-first-order kinetic models. The P adsorptive capture was controlled by MgHPO4 formation and electrostatic attraction, which was affected by the coexisting F− and CO32− ions. MFBC could recover more than 98% of P from the solution and bio-liquid wastewater. Although the P-adsorbed MFBC showed very limited reusability but it can be substituted for phosphate fertiliser in agricultural practices. This study provided an innovative technology for preparing MgO-biochar composite against P recovery from aqueous media, and also highlighted high-value-added approaches for resource utilization of bio-liquid wastewater and food waste.

TI  - Stability and interaction of biochar and iron  mineral nanoparticles: effect of pH, ionic strength, and dissolved organic matter
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 47
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar nanoparticles (BCNPs) and iron mineral nanoparticles (IMNPs), such as ferrihydrite nanoparticles (FHNPs), magnetite nanoparticles (MTNPs), and goethite nanoparticles (GTNPs), are often combined and used in soil remediation. However, the stability and interaction of nanoparticles under various environmental conditions have not been investigated previously. In this study, settling experiments, a semi-empirical model, the Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) theory, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations, and quantum chemical calculations were used to study the interaction and heteroaggregation of BCNPs and IMNPs. Settling of BCNPs-FHNPs and BCNPs-GTNPs was stable at neutral and alkaline pH (relative concentration of unsettled nanoparticles Cres’ = 0.679–0.824), whereas fast settling of BCNPs-IMNPs was observed at acidic pH (Cres’ = 0.104–0.628). By contrast, BCNPs-MTNPs consistently showed moderate settling regardless of the mass of magnetite at all pH (Cres’ = 0.423–0.673). Both humic acid (HA, 10 mg L−1) and ionic strength (IS, 10 and 100 mM) facilitated the settling of BCNPs-FHNPs and BCNPs-MTNPs systems, whereas the settling of BCNPs-GTNPs was sensitive only to IS. Fulvic acid (10 mg L−1) had a general stabilizing effect on the BCNPs-IMNPs systems. The results of SEM and quantum chemical calculations suggested that the interaction between BCNPs and FHNPs (-2755.58 kJ mol−1) was stronger than that between BCNPs and GTNPs (−1706.23 kJ mol−1) or MTNPs (−1676.73 kJ mol−1). The enhancement of heteroaggregation between BCNPs and IMNPs under unfavorable conditions (acidic pH, HA, and IS) was regulated by the strength of the interaction. Therefore, the enhancement of heteroaggregation of BCNPs-FHNPs was greater than that of BCNPs-MTNPs. In the BCNPs-GTNPs system, the high concentration and elongated structure of GTNPs may contribute greatly to heteroaggregation and settling with small interactions. Our results highlight the influence of pH, IS, and HA on the interaction between BCNPs and IMNPs. These results will be helpful in the application of BCNPs and IMNPs for soil remediation.

TI  - Application of biochar-based photocatalysts for adsorption-(photo)degradation/reduction of environmental contaminants: mechanism, challenges and perspective
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 45
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - The fast increase of population results in the quick development of industry and agriculture. Large amounts of contaminants such as metal ions and organic contaminants are released into the natural environment, posing a risk to human health and causing environment ecosystem problems. The efficient elimination of contaminants from aqueous solutions, photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants or the in-situ solidification/immobilization of heavy metal ions in solid phases are the most suitable strategies to decontaminate the pollution. Biochar and biochar-based composites have attracted multidisciplinary interests especially in environmental pollution management because of their porous structures, large amounts of functional groups, high adsorption capacities and photocatalysis performance. In this review, the application of biochar and biochar-based composites as adsorbents and/or catalysts for the adsorption of different contaminants, adsorption-photodegradation of organic pollutants, and adsorption-(photo)reduction of metal ions are summarized, and the mechanism was discussed from advanced spectroscopy analysis and DFT calculation in detail. The doping of metal or metal oxides is the main strategy to narrow the band gap, to increase the generation and separation of photogenerated e−-h+ pairs, to produce more superoxide radicals (·O2−) and hydroxyl radicals (·OH), to enhance the visible light absorption and to increase photocatalysis performance, which dominate the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants and (photo)reduction of high valent metals to low valent metals. The biochar-based composites are environmentally friendly materials, which are promising candidates in environmental pollution cleanup. The challenge and perspective for biochar-based catalysts are provided in the end.

TI  - Biochar mitigates the biotoxicity of heavy metals in livestock manure during composting
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 48
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - The addition of biochar could mitigate the bioavailability of heavy metals during livestock manure composting. However, the main action mechanism of biochar, such as how it worked, was ambiguous. Therefore, in this study, materials (biochar, alkali modified biochar, pretreated cotton ball) were added by embedding with nylon mesh bags to explore the adsorption performance of added materials and its influence on the composting process. The results showed that embedded materials promoted the formation of humic acid and reduced the distribution proportion of bioavailable fraction of heavy metals during composting (Cu: at least 15.72%; Zn: at least 33.44%). The surface of biochar extracted from composting contained attachments, however, the attachment of heavy metal was not detected and functional groups on the materials did no change significantly. This indicated that the addition of biochar did not directly adsorb heavy metals. Most notably, the microbial network changed after embedding materials, and the succession of microbial community promoted the formation of humic acid. Ultimately, structural equation models verified that embedded materials promoted the formation of humic acid through stable microbial groups, thereby accelerating the passivation of heavy metals during composting. This study provides theoretical and technical supports for mitigating the biotoxicity of heavy metals by biochar during composting.

TI  - The stability of carbon from a maize-derived hydrochar as a function of fractionation and hydrothermal carbonization temperature in a Podzol
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 52
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Hydrochar (HC) produced by the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of typically wet biomass is generally considered to be less effective for carbon (C) sequestration in soils compared to biochar (BC) by pyrolysis, due to a higher content of more easily decomposable C. Although the recalcitrance of HC is suggested to improve with increasing HTC production temperature, the way it interacts and becomes associated with soil organic matter (SOM) fractions of different stabilities against decomposition, may also influence its effectiveness for C sequestration in soils. In that respect, this study aimed to verify the potential of HCs from maize silage produced at different HTC temperatures (190, 210 and 230 °C) for C sequestration in a HC-amended sandy loam Podzol. To do this, we conducted a pot trial experiment and traced the fate of HC-derived C (HC-C) within different SOM fractions, namely the free- and occluded particulate organic matter (POMF and POMO, respectively) fractions and that comprising organic matter (OM) bound to clays (OMCl). Approx. 1 year after applying 5% of the different HTC temperature HCs to the soil, the SOM fractions were isolated by density fractionation for each HC treatment (HC190, HC210 and HC230) and the control (absent of HC). All fractions and the HCs were analyzed for organic C (OC) content and isotopic signatures (δ 13C). From the δ 13C signatures, the amount of HC-C and native soil organic carbon (SOC) within each fraction was calculated. Increased C contents and decreased H/C and O/C ratios were observed with increasing HTC production temperatures, which suggests a lower stability for the low temperature HC. After ca. 1 year, a loss of ~ 20–23% of the bulk soil TOC was found in the HC-amended soils. The POMF fraction of the HC-amended soils showed losses of 68–81% HC-C and 52–72% native SOC, which may be due to a positive priming effect caused by HC addition. The POMO and OMCl fractions of the HC-amended soils contained more OC than the control, indicating the integration of HC-C together with SOM within these more stable fractions, while the effect of HTC production temperature on the level of decomposition of the resultant HCs was negligible. In all HC treatments, the OMCl fraction comprised the least amount of HC-C, thus showing the weakest response to C amendment. In conclusion, long(er)-term research on the C net balance that accounts for the observed priming-induced TOC losses and the HC-C enrichment in more stable fractions is required to verify the potential of the different HCs for the purpose of C sequestration in soils.

TI  - Wood-derived biochar as thick electrodes for high-rate performance supercapacitors
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 50
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Developing effective electrodes with commercial-level active mass-loading (> 10 mg cm−2) is vital for the practical application of supercapacitors. However, high active mass-loading usually requires thick active mass layer, which severely hinders the ion/electron transport and results in poor capacitive performance. Herein, a self-standing biochar electrode with active mass-loading of ca. 40 mg cm−2 and thickness of 800 µm has been developed from basswood. The basswood was treated with formamide to incorporate N/O in the carbon structure, followed by mild KOH activation to ameliorate the pore size and introduce more O species in the carbon matrix. The as-prepared carbon monoliths possess well conductive carbon skeleton, abundant N/O dopant and 3D porous structure, which are favorable for the ion/electron transport and promoting capacitance performance. The self-standing carbon electrode not only exhibits the maximum areal/mass/volumetric specific capacitance of 5037.5 mF cm−2/172.5 F g−1/63.0 F cm−3 at 2 mA cm−2 (0.05 A g−1), but also displays excellent rate performance with 76% capacitance retention at 500 mA cm−2 (12.5 A g−1) in a symmetric supercapacitor, surpassing the state-of-art biomass-based thick carbon electrode. The assembled model can power typical electron devices including a fan, a digital watch and a logo made up of 34 light-emitting diodes for a proper period, revealing its practical application potential. This study not only puts forward a commercial-level high active mass-loading electrode from biomass for supercapacitor, but also bridges the gap between the experimental research and practical application.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 53
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - The development of biochar-based granule-like adsorbents suitable for scaled-up application has been attracting increasing attention in the field of water treatment. Herein, a new formable porous granulated biochar loaded with La-Fe(hydr)oxides/montmorillonite (LaFe/MB) was fabricated via a granulation and pyrolysis process for enhanced phosphorus (P) removal from wastewater. Montmorillonite acted as a binder that increased the size of the granulated biochar, while the use of Fe promoted the surface charge and facilitated the dispersion of La, which was responsible for selective phosphate removal. LaFe/MB exhibited rapid phosphate adsorption kinetics and  a high maximum adsorption capacity (Langmuir model, 52.12 mg P g−1), which were better than those of many existing granulated materials. The desorption and recyclability experiments showed that LaFe/MB could be regenerated, and maintained 76.7% of its initial phosphate adsorption capacity after four adsorption cycles. The high hydraulic endurance strength retention rate of the developed material (91.6%) suggested high practical applicability in actual wastewater. Electrostatic attraction, surface precipitation, and inner-sphere complexation via ligand exchange  were found to be involved in selective P removal over a wide pH range of 3–9. The thermodynamic parameters were determined, which revealed the feasibility and spontaneity of adsorption. Based on approximate site energy distribution analyses, high distribution frequency contributed to efficient P removal. The research results provide a new insight that LaFe/MB shows great application prospects for advanced phosphate removal from wastewater.

TI  - Long-term biochar addition significantly decreases rice rhizosphere available phosphorus and its release risk to the environment
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 54
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Phosphorus (P) availability, diffusion, and resupply processes can be altered by biochar addition in flooded rice rhizosphere, which controls the risk of P release to the environment. However, there are few in-situ investigations of these rhizospheric processes and effects. To explore the effects of biochar addition on soil P availability, high-resolution dialysis (HR-Peeper), diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT), and zymography techniques were used to provide direct evidence in the rice rhizosphere at the sub-millimeter scale. Long-term (9-years) field and greenhouse pot experiments demonstrated that biochar addition notably decreased the soluble/labile P and Fe concentrations in rice rhizosphere (vs. no biochar addition; CK) based on the results of Peeper, DGT, and two-dimensional imaging of labile P fluxes. DGT-induced fluxes in the soil/sediment (DIFS) model and sediment P release risk index (SPRRI) further indicated that biochar addition decreased the diffusion and resupply capacity of P from soil solid to the solution, thereby decreasing P release risk to the environment. These processes were dominated by Fe redox cycling and the hydrolysis of Al (hydro)oxides that greatly increased the unavailable P (Ca-P and residual-P). Additionally, greenhouse pot experiments (without additional biochar) showed that the previous long-term biochar addition significantly increased soil phosphatase activity, due to an adaptive-enhancing response to P decrease in the rhizosphere zone. The in-situ study on the biogeochemical reactions of P in the rice rhizosphere may provide a new and direct perspective to better evaluate the biochar addition and potential benefits to agricultural soils.

SP  - 57
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - To better understand the amendment effects and mechanisms of aluminum (Al(III)) phytotoxicity mitigation by different regional crop straw biochars, wheat seedling root elongation trials were conducted. The contributions of liming effect, oxygen-containing surface functional group adsorption, and oxyanions precipitation to Al(III) phytotoxicity mitigation by Ca(OH)2, pristine and ash-free canola straw biochar were evaluated. The results indicated that biochars derived from canola straw collected from four different regions (Yingtan, Xuancheng, Nanjing, and Huaiyin) caused 22–70% wheat seedling root elongation, which might be linked to liming effect. Incorporation of the corresponding ash-free biochars caused 15–30% elongation, which could be attributed to the surface functional group adsorption. About 0–60% of changes could be explained by Al(III) precipitation with inorganic oxyanions. These findings provide new insights into the physicochemical properties, potential applications, efficiencies, and underlying mechanisms of crop straw biochar in alleviating Al(III) phytotoxicity, which is dependent on the cultivation soil, and indicate similar application of crop straw biochar for acidic soil amelioration, contaminated soil remediation, and arable soil improvement.

JO  - Biochar

VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - There have been many studies on soil quality and crop yield using different biochar application amounts, but few studies have focused on the combination of different methods and amounts of biochar application in moderately degraded Mollisols. In this study, the methods of mixing biochar evenly with the soil of the plough layer (0–20 cm depth) [homogeneous biochar application (HO)] and burying biochar above the soil plow pan (under 20 cm depth) (heterogeneous biochar application (HE)) were used to reveal how biochar application methods influenced  soil quality, crop yield and agronomic characteristics in moderately degraded Mollisols (soil organic matter (SOM), 30.33 g kg−1). The biochar application amounts were 0 (control), 10 (level 1), 20 (level 2), and 40 (level 3) t ha−1 in both the HO and HE treatments. The results showed that, compared with control, HO3 significantly increased maize yield in the first year, and HO2, HO3, HE2 and HE3 continuously increased maize yield in the next three years but not significantly. HO1 and HE1 had the lowest maize yield. HO2 tended to delay maize leaf senescence. There was a positive linear relationship between soil quality index (SQI) and biochar application amount in HO. Compared with other treatments, the pH, EC, SOM, available phosphorus, sucrase and catalase activities were highest in HO3. However, the effects of HE on soil quality and crop productivity were limited at first but gradually increased with time. Overall, HO3 was beneficial for improving the soil quality and crop productivity in Mollisols for short-term cultivation (3-year), while HE showed an effect over time.

TI  - Arsenic removal from water and soils using pristine and modified biochars
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 55
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Arsenic (As) is recognized as a persistent and toxic contaminant in the environment that is harmful to humans. Biochar, a porous carbonaceous material with tunable functionality, has been used widely as an adsorbent for remediating As-contaminated water and soils. Several types of pristine and modified biochar are available, and significant efforts have been made toward modifying the surface of biochars to increase their adsorption capacity for As. Adsorption capacity is influenced by multiple factors, including biomass pyrolysis temperature, pH, the presence of dissolved organic carbon, surface charge, and the presence of phosphate, silicate, sulfate, and microbial activity. Improved As adsorption in modified biochars is attributed to several mechanisms including surface complexation/precipitation, ion exchange, oxidation, reduction, electrostatic interactions, and surface functional groups that have a relatively higher affinity for As. Modified biochars show promise for As adsorption; however, further research is required to improve the performance of these materials. For example, modified biochars must be eco-friendly, cost-effective, reliable, efficient, and sustainable to ensure their widespread application for immobilizing As in contaminated water and soils. Conducting relevant research to address these issues relies on a thorough understanding of biochar modifications to date. This study presents an in-depth review of pristine and modified biochars, including their production, physicochemical properties, and As adsorption mechanisms. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation of biochar applications is provided in As-contaminated environments as a guide for selecting suitable biochars for As removal in the field.

JO  - Biochar

VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar is a waste-derived material that can sequester carbon at a large scale. The development of low-carbon and sustainable biochar-enhanced construction materials has attracted extensive interest. Biochar, having a porous nature and highly functionalised surface, can provide nucleation sites for chemical reactions and exhibit compatibility with cement, asphalt, and polymer materials. This study critically reviewed the state-of-the-art biochar-enhanced construction materials, including biochar-cement composites, biochar-asphalt composites, biochar-plastic composites, etc. The efficacies and mechanisms of biochar as construction materials were articulated to improve their functional properties. This critical review highlighted the roles of biochar in cement hydration, surface functional groups of engineered biochar for promoting chemical reactions, and value-added merits of biochar-enhanced construction materials (such as humidity regulation, thermal insulation, noise reduction, air/water purification, electromagnetic shielding, and self-sensing). The major properties of biochar are correlated to the features and functionalities of biochar-enhanced construction materials. Further advances in our understanding of biochar’s roles in various composites can foster the next-generation design of carbon–neutral construction materials.

TI  - Machine learning predicting and engineering the yield, N content, and specific surface area of biochar derived from pyrolysis of biomass
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 63
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar produced from pyrolysis of biomass has been developed as a platform carbonaceous material that can be used in various applications. The specific surface area (SSA) and functionalities such as N-containing functional groups of biochar are the most significant properties determining the application performance of biochar as a carbon material in various areas, such as removal of pollutants, adsorption of CO2 and H2, catalysis, and energy storage. Producing biochar with preferable SSA and N functional groups is among the frontiers to engineer biochar materials. This study attempted to build machine learning models to predict and optimize specific surface area of biochar (SSA-char), N content of biochar (N-char), and yield of biochar (Yield-char) individually or simultaneously, by using elemental, proximate, and biochemical compositions of biomass and pyrolysis conditions as input variables. The  predictions of Yield-char, N-char, and SSA-char were compared by using random forest (RF) and gradient boosting regression (GBR) models. GBR outperformed RF for most predictions. When input parameters included elemental and proximate compositions as well as pyrolysis conditions, the test R2 values for the single-target and multi-target GBR models were 0.90–0.95 except  for  the two-target prediction of Yield-char and SSA-char which had a test R2 of 0.84 and the three-target prediction model which had a test R2 of 0.81. As indicated by the Pearson correlation coefficient between variables and the feature importance of these GBR models, the top influencing factors toward predicting three targets were specified as follows: pyrolysis temperature, residence time, and fixed carbon for Yield-char; N and ash for N-char; ash and pyrolysis temperature for SSA-char. The effects of these parameters on three targets were different, but the trade-offs of these three were balanced during multi-target ML prediction and optimization. The optimum solutions were then experimentally verified, which opens a new way for designing smart biochar with target properties and oriented application potential.

TI  - Development of a new hydrophobic magnetic biochar for removing oil spills on the water surface
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 60
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - More technologies are urgently needed for combined use to effectively eliminate the effect of oil spills, an environmental problem of widespread concern. Among these technologies, sorption methods are available to remove residual oil and prevent the further spread on the water surface. In this study, biochars, prepared from different feedstock materials and pyrolysis temperatures, were screened and further modified to improve their application in the water environment. Among cornstalk biochar (CSBC), corncob biochar (CCBC), Sophora sawdust biochar (SSBC), and rice husk biochar (RHBC), the CSBC had excellent oil sorption capacity, especially prepared at 350℃ (CSBC350), which has a complete and full pore structure. Furthermore, magnetic and silane agent modifications of CSBC350 (OMBC) were performed to enhance the properties of the magnetic field controllability and hydrophobicity to increase oil sorption. The OMBC exhibited satisfactory oil sorption capacities to crude oil, diesel oil, and engine oil in the water-oil system of 8.77 g g−1, 4.01 g g−1, and 4.44 g g−1, respectively. The sorption process of CSBC350 and OMBC complied with the pseudo-second-order kinetics (R2 > 0.97) and the Langmuir isotherm models (R2 > 0.80) based on the highest regression coefficients. The sorption mechanisms are dominated by hydrophobic forces, pore intercepts, and hydrogen-bond interactions. The biochar adsorbent can availably cooperate with other physical methods to eliminate oil contaminants, which can be an outstanding fuel source for producing heat.

VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar from bio-waste pyrolysis presents excellent CO2 sequestration capacity. This study innovated the design of cement-bonded particleboards utilizing a substantial amount of 50–70 wt.% pre-soaked biochar to render the products carbon-negative. We investigated the roles of biochar in magnesium oxysulfate cement (MOSC) system and demonstrated good mechanical and functional properties of biochar cement particleboards. In the presence of biochar, the amounts of hydration products were enriched in the cement systems as illustrated by the thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). We further incorporated supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) and generated 5 Mg(OH)2⋅MgSO4·7H2O (5–1–7) phase in the MOSC system. As a result, our designs of biochar particleboards satisfied the standard requirements for flexural strength (> 5.5 MPa) and thickness swelling (< 2%). Moreover, our biochar particleboards presented a low thermal conductivity as the biochar pores disrupted thermal bridging within particleboards. We illustrated that the high dosage ratio of biochar could significantly offset the CO2 emissions of the particleboards (i.e., carbon-negative) via life cycle assessment. Noticeable economic profits could also be accomplished for the biochar particleboards. For instance, the 50BC-MOSC bonded particleboard (with 50 wt.% pre-soaked biochar as aggregate, 50 wt.% MOSC as binder) with promising mechanical properties could store 137 kg CO2 tonne−1 and yield an overall economic profit of 92 to 116 USD m−3 depending on the carbon prices in different countries. In summary, our new designs of carbon-negative biochar particleboards could curtail carbon emissions in the construction materials and promote the realization of carbon neutrality and circular economy.

TI  - Biochar granulation reduces substrate erosion on green roofs
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 61
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Green roofs are exposed to high winds and harsh environmental conditions that can degrade vegetation and erode substrate material, with negative consequences to ecosystem services. Biochar has been promoted as an effective substrate additive to enhance plant performance, but unprocessed biochars are susceptible to wind and water erosion. Applications of granulated biochars or chemical dust suppressants are suggested as a means to mitigate biochar and substrate erosion; however, research on biochar type and chemical dust suppressant use on biochar and substrate erosion is lacking. Vegetation is a crucial factor that influences substrate erosion, yet plant responses may vary with biochar type and chemical dust suppressant; thus, the effects of possible mitigation measures on biochar and substrate erosion are unclear. We investigated the effects of surface-applied granulated and unprocessed biochars and an organic dust suppressant (Entac™) on biochar and substrate erosion on green roofs with Sedum album L. and a native plant mix. Our results show that 94% of unprocessed biochars were lost from green roofs after 2 years regardless of the Entac™ amendment, likely due to the lightweight nature and fragmentation of biochar particles. In contrast, granulation of biochars reduced the biochar erosion and total substrate erosion by 74% and 39%, respectively, possibly due to enhanced biochar bulk density and particle size and improved moisture retention of biochar-amended substrates. Additionally, Sedum album better reduced biochar and substrate erosion than the native plant mix, likely due to rapid development of high vegetation cover that reduced wind exposure and enhanced substrate moisture retention. We conclude that applications of granulated biochars can substantially reduce biochar and substrate erosion on green roofs, improving green roof sustainability.

VL  - 4

AB  - Anaerobic digestion (AD) has been considered as a promising technique for food waste (FW) recycling. However, the accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) restricts the stability of anaerobic reactors. The present study investigated the use of biochar produced at different conditions (750 °C-30 min, 750 °C-60 min, 750 °C-120 min, 550 °C-60 min, 650 °C-60 min, 850 °C-60 min, 950 °C-60 min) for enhancing the AD of FW. Batch experiments showed that all the biochar increased the methane production rates and biochar obtained at 750 °C-60 min resulted in the highest enhancement by 21.5%. It was further showed surface oxygen-containing functional groups and graphitization degree of biochar were the critical factors for improving methane production. Microbial analysis showed that biochar addition formed different microbial communities, and Methanosaeta, Romboutsia, and norank_f_Anaerolineaceae were enriched, which might be correlated with direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET). This research showed biochar could enhance the AD of FW and also revealed the main characteristics of biochar relating with the enhancement of AD.

TI  - Biochar-supported nano-scale zerovalent iron activated persulfate for remediation of aromatic hydrocarbon-contaminated  soil: an in-situ pilot-scale study
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 64
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar supported nano-scale zerovalent iron (nZVI/BC) for persulfate (PS) activation has been studied extensively for the degradation of pollutants on the lab scale, but it was rarely applied in practical soil remediation in the field. In this research, we developed a facile ball-milling method for the mass production of nZVI/BC, which was successfully applied to activate persulfate for the remediation of organic polluted soil on an in-situ pilot scale. In-situ high-pressure injection device was developed to inject nZVI/BC suspension and PS solution into the soil with a depth of 0–70 cm. The removal efficiency of target pollutants such as 2-ethylnitrobenzene (ENB, 1.47–1.56 mg/kg), biphenyl (BP, 0.19–0.21  mg/kg), 4-(methylsulfonyl) toluene (MST, 0.32–0.43 mg/kg), and 4-phenylphenol (PP, 1.70–2.46  mg/kg)  at different soil depths was 99.7%, 99.1%, 99.9% and 99.7%, respectively, after  360 days of remediation. The application of nZVI/BC significantly increased the degradation rates of contaminants by 11–322%, ascribed to its relatively higher efficiency of free radical generation than that of control groups. In addition, it was found that nZVI/BC-PS inhibited soil urease and sucrase enzyme activities by 1–61% within 55 days due to the oxidative stress for microbes induced by free radicals, while these inhibition effects disappeared with remediation time prolonged (> 127 days). Our research provides a useful implementation case of remediation with nZVI/BC-PS activation and verifies its feasibility in practical contaminated soil remediation.

SP  - 66
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Numerous studies have reported the potential of silica as a biochar (BC) modifier. However, despite its high silica content, fly ash is rarely used for BC modification. Herein, modified BCs were produced by co-pyrolysis of corn stalks with alkali-fused fly ash (AFFA) at 200 and 600 °C (denoted as AFFA/BC). The Pb(II) adsorption mechanism and adsorption performance were investigated. The AFFA/BC had larger specific surface areas than the pure BC samples (2.54–137 vs. 0.50 m2 g−1) owing to their stable carbon structure. The Pb(II) adsorption capacity of AFFA/BC in water was approximately 6% higher than that of BC owing to the increased cation (Na+) exchange and new bonding sites, such as C–O and Si–O. AFFA/BC exhibited good Pb(II) adsorption performance in high-concentration simulated wastewater (pH 4–6), with a maximum adsorption capacity of 110.29 mg g−1. The Pb(II) adsorption mechanism was in accordance with the pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models. At 25 °C and pH 5, the theoretical Pb(II) adsorption capacities of AFFA200/BC and AFFA600/BC were 201.66 and 186.81 mg g−1, respectively, compared to 145.98 mg g−1  of BC. Physical adsorption, precipitation, cation exchange, and complexation were identified as the main Pb(II) adsorption mechanisms through X-ray photoelectron spectrometry.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 65
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Graphene-based composite aerogel doped with other low-cost materials can reduce the cost and promote the use in water treatment. This work prepared ball-milled biochar/reduced graphene oxide aerogel (BC/rGA) using GO and low-cost ball-milled biochar (BC) in a certain proportion with the freeze-thawing technique and sol–gel method, and applied BC/rGA on the Cr(VI) removal from aquatic environments. The characterization results showed that aerogel had a honeycomb briquette three-dimension (3D) and mesoporous structure with interconnected pores, and proved the preparation progress of aerogel in principle. Compared with GO, rGA and BC/rGA had better adsorption performance with 3D structure and well-developed pores, and BC/rGA with the mixture ratio of BC and GO of 1:4 was more appropriate. The adsorption kinetics data of rGA and BC/rGA(1:4) were fitting well with the pseudo-second-order model (R2 > 0.951), and the isotherm adsorption results were fitting the Langmuir model well (R2 > 0.974). The results demonstrated that the adsorption process was monolayer and endothermic adsorption involving chemisorption. Additionally, the adsorption capacities of rGA and BC/rGA(1:4) at solution pH 2 were 3.71 and 3.89 times greater than those at solution pH 8, respectively. High background ion strength and low temperature slightly inhibited the adsorption of Cr(VI) by both rGA and BC/rGA(1:4). The adsorption mechanisms of Cr(VI) on rGA and BC/rGA(1:4) were electrostatic interaction, reduction and ion exchange. The use of BC/rGA could reduce the cost and promote the green reuse of agricultural waste. Overall, BC/rGA could be used as a promising green adsorbent alternative for the feasible treatment of heavy metal contaminated water.

VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar amendment of soil may ameliorate inherently infertile soils, such as in the typical coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) growth areas along tropical coasts, where, moreover, temporary moisture stress commonly occurs. We conducted a pot experiment to evaluate the effects of biochar soil amendment (1% w/w) produced from Gliricidia sepium stems (BC-Gly) and rice husks (BC-RiH) on the growth of coconut seedlings and on N and P uptake mediated by mycorrhizae under wet or dry conditions in a Sandy Regosol. The pots were divided into root and hyphal zones by a nylon mesh, where 15N labelled N and P nutrients were only provided in the hyphal zone. Under wet conditions, biochar application did not affect plant growth, while under dry conditions, the BC-Gly increased root and plant growth similar to that under wet conditions. BC-Gly increased the acidic pH of the soil to a neutral level, and the microbial community shifted towards a higher fungal abundance. The P accumulated (Pacc) in roots was higher with BC-Gly and BC-RiH under dry and wet conditions, respectively. Pacc weakly correlated with the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the hyphal zone. With BC-Gly roots showed lower N derived from fertilizer. We conclude that biochar application has no impact on crop growth under wet conditions, while under dry conditions, BC-Gly stimulates crop growth and P uptake, probably through liming induced P availability but also possibly by some enhancement of AMF growth. The shift in the fungal-oriented microbial community and reduced plant fertilizer N uptake suggested that BC-Gly acted as an additional N source.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 69
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Co-contamination of groundwater with trichloroethene (TCE) and arsenic (As) is a widespread problem in industrial sites. The simultaneous biological removal of As and TCE has not yet been developed. This study incorporated biochar into anaerobic dechlorination system to achieve a greatly accelerated dissipation and co-removal of TCE and As. Biochar eliminated microbial lag (6 days) and achieved a 100% TCE removal within 12 days even at a relatively high initial concentration (TCE: 30 mg L−1; As(V): 4 mg L−1), while without biochar, only 75% TCE was removed until day 18. Biochar adsorbed TCE and the intermediate products allowing them to be degraded on its surface gradually, maintaining a high metabolic activity of microbes. Biochar facilitated the preferential colonization of its surfaces by dechlorinating microorganisms (Clostridium and Dehalococcoides) and suppressed hydrogen-competing microorganisms (Desulfovibrio) in water. Biochar itself cannot adsorb As, however, separation of biochar carrying the As-laden microorganisms achieved 50–70% As-removal from groundwater. The biochar-amended incubations were found to be enriched with microbes possessing more crucial As-transforming genes (K00537-arsC and K07755-AS3MT), and upregulated amino acid metabolism, thus enhancing the self-detoxification ability of microorganisms to transform As(V) to As(III) or volatile organic As. This study proposes a strategy of regulating microbes’ metabolic activity by biochar to achieve simultaneous removal of coexisting contaminations, which is an important step prior to examining the feasibility of biochar application for enhanced bioremediation.

TI  - Use of sewage sludge biochar as a catalyst in production of biodiesel through thermally induced transesterification
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 67
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Sewage sludge (SS) is a residual/semi-solid material produced from industrial and municipal wastewater treatment processes. SS contains a high content of lipids and earth alkaline metals that can be used as catalysts for various chemical applications; however, its valorization has rarely been the focus of research. This study demonstrates that SS could be a promising raw material for biodiesel production and a biochar catalyst to promote the reaction kinetics of alkylation. Thermally induced transesterification of the SS extract (SSE) was performed in comparison with the conventional homogeneous reaction. SS biochar was fabricated via pyrolysis. The highest yield (33.5 wt.% per SSE) of biodiesel production was achieved in 1 min of reaction at 305 °C via thermally induced transesterification in the presence of SS biochar, while the yield of biodiesel from (trans)esterification with 5 wt.% H2SO4 was less than 1% even after 24 h. The reaction kinetics (< 1 min) of thermally induced transesterification was extraordinarily faster than that of conventional transesterification (3–24 h). The porous structure and high content of alkaline species in the SS biochar expedited the reaction kinetics. Consequently, the integrated/hybridized process for thermally induced transesterification and pyrolysis of the solid residue of SS was experimentally proved for the valorization of SS in this study. Considering that SS is being disposed of as a waste material and generates toxic chemicals in the environment, its valorization into value-added biodiesel and a catalyst could be an environmentally benign and sustainable technique.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 72
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar applications have an enormous impact on the soil microbial community and functionality. However, the majority of the knowledge on biochar–microbe interaction derives almost exclusively from bacterial and fungal studies, while the vast majority of eukaryotic diversity, protists, are mostly neglected. Protists play important roles in the soil ecosystem as microbial predators, decomposers, photoautotrophs, pathogens, and parasites and they are essential for a healthy soil ecosystem. Toward a comprehensive understanding of the effects of biochar application, we need more studies on protists across the full breadth of eukaryotic diversity. The aim of this article is to highlight the research needs and discuss potential research ideas on biochar–protist interaction, which would advance our knowledge of biochar–microbe interaction.

TI  - Pyrolytic synthesis of graphene-encapsulated zero-valent iron nanoparticles supported on biochar for heavy metal removal
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 70
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar (BC)-supported graphene-encapsulated zero-valent iron nanoparticle composites (BC-G@Fe0) are promising engineering nanocomposites that can be used to scavenge heavy metal from wastewater. However, the production of BC-G@Fe0 through carbothermal reduction using biomass as a carbon source remains challenging because of biomass pyrolysis complications. Here, we examined two carbothermal reduction routes for preparing BC-G@Fe0 using bamboo as the carbon source. The first route impregnated Fe ions (Fe2+/3+) into unpyrolyzed bamboo particles initially, followed by carbonization at 600–1000 °C. This process produced BC-G@Fe0 dominated by  iron carbide (Fe3C), which led to low heavy metal removal efficiency (i.e., Cu2+ capacity of < 0.3 mmol g−1). In the second route, bamboo particles were pyrolyzed (600 °C) to biochar first, followed by impregnating this biochar with Fe ions, and then  carbonized at 600–1000 °C. This route produces zero-valent iron nanoparticles, which resulted in high heavy metal removal capacities (i.e., 0.30, 1.58, and 1.91 mmol g−1 for Pb2+, Cu2+, and Ag+, respectively). The effects of carbonization temperature (600–1000 °C), iron source (i.e., iron nitrates, iron sulfate, ferrous chloride, and ferric chloride), and iron loading (5–40%) on the morphology, structure, and heavy metal ion aqueous uptake performance of BC-G@Fe0 were also investigated. This study revealed the formation mechanisms of BC-G@Fe0 through biomass carbothermal reduction, which could guide the application-oriented design of multifunctional iron-BC composites for water remediation.

TI  - Synergy effect between tetracycline and Cr(VI) on combined pollution systems driving biochar-templated Fe3O4@SiO2/TiO2/g-C3N4 composites for enhanced removal of pollutants
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 1
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar-coupled Fe3O4@SiO2/TiO2/g-C3N4 composites were successfully constructed through simple sol–gel and calcination methods. The composites efficiently removed high-concentration toxic tetracycline (TC) by means of ·OH and ·$${\rm O}_2^{-}$$, whose removal rate exhibited 91.88% during 3 h, and the degradation rate constant reached up to 0.0068 min−1. The excellent performance can be attributed to the high specific surface area, enhanced visible light response, the introduction of magnetic nanoparticles and biochars expediting charge transfer, Z-scheme heterojunction enhancing the spatial separation of photo-generate carriers and, importantly extraordinary adsorption capacity of 147.96 mg g−1. Moreover, the composites showed the most excellent efficiency under the calcination temperature of 450 ℃, and exhibited good stability with tolerance to a wide range of pH and anions. Interestingly, a synergistic photocatalytic effect was discovered in the TC/Cr(VI) combined pollution systems, resulting in significantly improved removal of Cr(VI). Besides, the photocatalytic mechanism and degradation path of tetracycline were also elucidated. All these findings suggested the as-synthesized catalyst was an excellent photocatalyst for removal of TC/Cr(VI)-contaminated water.

JO  - Biochar

VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar (BC) and nanoparticle-decorated biochar (NPs@BC) have emerged as potential high-performance function materials to facilitate simultaneous soil remediation and agricultural production. Therefore, there is an urgent need to incorporate environmental sustainability and human health targets into BC and NPs@BC selection and design processes. In contrast to extensive research on the preparation, modification, and environmental application of BC to soil ecosystems, reports about the adapted framework and material selection strategy of NPs@BC under environmental and human health considerations are still limited. Nevertheless, few studies systematically explored the impact of NPs@BC on soil ecosystems, including soil biota, geochemical properties, and nutrient cycles, which are critical for large-scale utilization as a multifunctional product. The main objective of this systematic literature review is  to show the high degrees of contaminant removal for different heavy metals and organic pollutants, and to quantify the economic, environmental, and toxicological outcomes of NPs@BC in the context of sustainable agriculture. To address this need, in this review, we summarized  synthesis techniques and characterization, and  highlighted  a linkage between the evolution of NPs@BC properties with the framework for sustainable NPs@BC selection and design based on environmental effects, hazards, and economic considerations. Then, research advances in contaminant remediation for heavy metals and organic pollutants of NPs@BC are minutely discussed. Eventually, NPs@BC positively acts on sustainable agriculture, which is declared. In the meantime, evaluating from the perspective of plant growth, soil characterizations as well as carbon and nitrogen cycle  was conducted, which is critical for comprehending the NPs@BC environmental sustainability. Our work may develop a potential framework that can inform decision-making for  the use of NPs@BC to facilitate promising environmental applications and prevent unintended consequences, and is expected to guide and boost the development of highly efficient NPs@BC for sustainable agriculture and environmental applications.

TI  - The influencing mechanism of O2, H2O, and CO2 on the H2S removal of food waste digestate-derived biochar with abundant minerals
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 71
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) removal has been a significant concern in various industries. In this study, food waste digestate-derived biochar (DFW-BC), a by-product of food waste treatment with abundant minerals, was assessed for removing H2S from different simulated biogas containing oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) and under different moisture (H2O) contents (0% and 20%) of biochar. The influencing mechanisms of the gas conditions combined with the moisture contents were also investigated. The results showed an H2S removal of 1.75 mg g−1 for dry biochar under pure H2S, 4.29 mg g−1 for dry biochar under H2S + O2, 5.29 mg g−1 for humid biochar under H2S, and 12.50 mg g−1 for humid biochar under H2S + O2. For dry DFW-BC, the high Fe content was responsible for the O2 enhancement. In contrast, O2 + H2O activated the catalytic H2S oxidation of the less reactive minerals (mainly Ca). The inhibition of CO2 on H2S adsorption was not obvious for dry DFW-BC; the specific pore structure may have provided a buffer against the physisorption competition of CO2. However, when H2O was present on DFW-BC, the changes in critical biochar properties and sulfur speciation as opposed to that without H2O implied an evident occurrence of CO2 chemisorption. This CO2 chemisorption partially hindered O2 + H2O enhancement, decreasing the H2S removal capacity from 12.50 to 8.88 mg g−1. The negative effect was ascribed to mineral carbonation of CO2, neutralizing the alkaline surface and immobilizing metal oxides, which thus reduced the acceleration in H2S dissociation and activation in catalytic H2S oxidation by O2 + H2O.

TI  - Regulated adsorption sites using atomically single cluster over biochar for efficient elemental mercury uptake
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 13
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - Carbon-based materials have been widely used in gaseous pollutant removal because of their sufficient surface functional groups; however, its removal efficiency for elemental mercury (Hg0) is low. In this study, we fabricated biomass using a chelated coupled pyrolysis strategy and further constructed the regulated adsorption sites for gaseous Hg0 uptake. A series of Mnδ-N2O2/BC with different manganese cluster sizes demonstrated that manganese clusters anchored on biochar acted as highly active and durable adsorbents for Hg0 immobilization, which increased the adsorption efficiency of Hg0 by up to 50%. Shrimp- and crab-based biochar adsorbents exhibited excellent Hg0 removal because of their chitosan-like structure. In particular, small Mn clusters and oxygen species around the defect led to a boost in the Hg0 adsorption by carbon. The results of density functional theory calculation revealed that the presence of oxygen in the carbon skeleton can tune the electrons of small-sized Mn clusters, thereby promoting the affinity of mercury atoms. The newly developed Mnδ-N2O2/BCshrimp had an adsorption capacity of 7.98–11.52 mg g−1 over a broad temperature range (50–200 °C) and showed a high tolerance to different industrial flue gases (H2O, NO, HCl, and SO2). These results provide novel green and low-carbon disposal methods for biomass resource utilization and industrial Hg0 emission control.

TI  - Nanobiochar for the remediation of contaminated soil and water: challenges and opportunities
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 2
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - Although research on biochar has received increasing attention for environmental and agricultural applications, the significance of nanobiochar for environmental pollutant  remediation is poorly understood. In contrast to bulk biochar, nanobiochar has superior physicochemical properties such as high catalytic activity, unique nanostructure, large specific surface area and high mobility in the soil environment. These unique characteristics make nanobiochar an ideal candidate for pollution remediation. Thus far, the research on nanobiochar is still in its infancy and most of the previous studies have only been  conducted for exploring its properties and environmental functions. The lack of in-depth summary of nanobiochar’s research direction makes it a challenge for scientists and researchers globally. Hence in this review, we established some key fabrication methods for nanobiochar with a focus on its performance for the removal of pollutants from the environment. We also provided up-to-date information on nanobiochar’s role in environmental remediation and insights into different mechanisms involved in the pollutant removal. Although, nanobiochar application is increasing, the associated drawbacks to the soil ecosystem have not received enough research attention. Therefore, further research is warranted to evaluate the potential environmental risks of nanobiochar before large scale application.

JO  - Biochar

IS  - 1
AB  - Although composting is a very effective way to dispose agricultural wastes, its development is greatly limited by the low compost quality and greenhouse gas emissions. At present, there is a lack of effective means to solve these two problems simultaneously. Here, the effects of three additives of compound microbial agent, biochar and biochar carried microbial agent on the composting performance, nitrogen transformation, greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions, and bacterial communities were investigated in sheep manure composting during 28 days. Results showed that biochar carried microbial agent prolonged the thermophilic stage and promoted compost maturity. At the same time, it was confirmed by the increase of the decomposition of organic nitrogen and the transformation of NH4+-N to NO3−-N. Besides, adding biochar carried microbial agent decreased CH4, NH3 and N2O emissions by 65.23%, 42.05% and 68.64%, respectively. The gas emissions were mainly correlated to Chloroflexi, Myxococcota, Acidobacteriota, Firmicutes, and Gemmatimonadota. Redundancy analysis showed that EC and TKN were closely related to bacterial community. Therefore, biochar carried microbial agent is recommended as an effective additive to enhance compost quality and reduce gas emissions during sheep manure composting.

TI  - Optimizing biochar addition for vermicomposting: a comprehensive evaluation of earthworms’ activity, N2O emissions and compost quality
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 4
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar addition has been widely used in the field to mitigate soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and can be considered as a potential method to reduce N2O emissions during vermicomposting. However, excessive biochar addition may inhibit earthworms’ activity. Thus, it is crucial to clarify the optimum addition volumes of biochar during vermicomposting. This study evaluated the impact of addition of various amounts of biochar (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25% of total amount of feedstock) on earthworms’ (Eisenia fetida) activity, N2O emission and compost quality during vermicomposting. Compared with the treatment without biochar added, 5% of biochar application significantly increased earthworm total biomass (from 177.5 to 202.2 g pot−1), and cumulative burrowing activity (from 47.0% to 52.2% pixel per terrarium). The increased earthworms activity stimulated the vermicomposting process and led to the best quality of compost, which showed the highest total nutrient content (5.38%) and a significantly higher germination percentage of seeds (88%). Although N2O emissions were slightly increased by 5% biochar addition, a non-significant difference was found between the treatment with 5% biochar and the treatment without biochar added. On the contrary, 20% and 25% biochar addition not only lowered N2O emissions, but also significantly decreased the quality of compost. The results suggest that 5% biochar application is an appropriate amount to improve the quality of compost without significant N2O emissions.

JO  - Biochar

AB  - As a bioproduct from the thermal decomposition of biomass, biochar has various applications in diversified field. In this study, a bibliometric analysis was conducted to visualize the current research status and trends of biochar research. A total of 5535 documents were collected from the Web of Science Core Collection and subjected to visualization analysis for the biochar field's development in 2021 with CiteSpace software. The visual analysis results demonstrate that the number of publications expanded dramatically in 2021, and the growth trend would continue. China and USA were the most contributing countries in biochar research in terms of the number of publications. Based on the keyword co-occurrence analyses, “Biochar for toxic metal immobilization”, “Biochar-based catalyst for biofuel production”, “Biochar for global climate change mitigation”, “Biochar for salinity and drought stress amelioration”, “Biochar amendment in composting”, and “Biochar as additives in anaerobic digestion” were the main research trends and hotspots in this field in 2021. This indicates that the biochar research was multidisciplinary. Regarding the research hotspots, the employment of biochar as heterogeneous catalysts for biofuel production gained great attention in 2021. On the contrary, bioremediation using functional bacteria immobilized on biochar and biochar-assisted advanced oxidation process were well-studied but with less frequency than other topics in 2021. Furthermore, the future research was proposed for green and sustainable applications of biochar. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the research frontiers, the evolution of research hotspots, and potential future research directions in the biochar field.

JO  - Biochar

VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - Due to the poor surface/interfacial interaction and the large gaps in the size and microstructure between biomass and clay mineral, it was difficult to adjust the structure and performance of biochar/clay mineral composites at the molecular level. Herein, oil shale semi-coke composed of multi-minerals and organic matters was used as a promising precursor to prepare biochar/clay mineral nanocomposites via phosphoric acid-assisted hydrothermal treatment followed by KOH activation for removal of organic pollutants from aqueous solution. The results revealed that the nanocomposites presented well-defined sheet-like morphology, and the carbon species uniformly anchored on the surface of clay minerals. With the changes in the pore structure, surface charge and functional groups after two-step modification, the nanocomposites exhibited much better adsorption property toward organic pollutants than the raw oil shale semi-coke, and the maximum adsorption capacities of methylene blue, methyl violet, tetracycline, and malachite green were 165.30 mg g−1, 159.02 mg g−1, 145.89 mg g−1, and 2137.36 mg g−1, respectively. The adsorption mechanisms involved electrostatic attraction, π–π stacking and hydrogen bonds. After five consecutive adsorption–desorption, there was no obvious decrease in the adsorption capacity of malachite green, exhibiting good cyclic regeneration performance. It is expected to provide a feasible strategy for the preparation of biochar/clay mineral nanocomposites with the excellent adsorption performances for removal of organic pollutants based on full-component resource utilization of oil shale semi-coke.

JO  - Biochar

VL  - 5

AB  - Modified biochar with higher electron transport and adsorption capabilities could significantly improve the performance of anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox). However, there are few related investigations on the reinforcement of anammox through iron-modified Enteromorpha prolifera biochar (IMEPB). In this study, with the addition of the IMEPB in the anammox system, the enhancing process of anammox performance was studied, the improving feasibility of anammox was evaluated, and the reinforcing mechanism of anammox was elucidated. The results showed that the optimal iron−charcoal ratio (Fe:C) and IMEPB dosage were 1:10 and 10 g L−1, respectively. Under the optimal conditions, when the nitrogen loading rate gradually increased to 0.557 (kg m−3 day−1), the nitrogen removal efficiency and nitrogen removal rate of the anammox process supplemented with IMEPB increased by 11%, and the specific anammox activity increased by 23.8%. Compared with the control, the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of anammox bacteria supplemented IMEPB increased by 24.4%, greatly improving the stability of the anammox system. Meanwhile, EPS secretion further promoted the microbial activity of anammox bacteria, achieving a 19% increase in the abundance of Candidatus Brocadia. These findings demonstrate the potential mechanism of IMEPB in improving anammox, provide new insights into recycling E. prolifera, and provide a novel reinforcement strategy for anammox. In the future, adding IMEPB may be a vital measure for the practical application of anammox in coastal areas.

IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar is a carbon-containing material prepared through thermal treatment of biomass in limited supply of oxygen, and used for an array of applications including waste management, climate change mitigation, soil fertility improvement, bio-energy production, and contaminant remediation. The data related to biochar, its production, and the wide applicability were collected using Web of Science Core Collection Database (on 25/10/2022), while bibliometric network analysis was performed using VOSviewer software to analyse year-wise, author-wise, country-wise, and journal-wise publication trends, construct keyword co-occurrence maps, and identify research areas receiving greater focus. Further, the applications of biochar were reviewed and mechanistic insights were provided. Some of the findings include: > 50% of documents (> 13,000) getting published in the past 3 years, > 90% of documents (> 21,000) being research articles, ~ 50% of publications (> 10,000) being related to environmental sciences, pyrolysis being the most widely used (~ 40% articles) production technique (followed by carbonization, gasification, combustion, and torrefaction), China being the most active country in terms of publications (> 11,000), and biochar being mostly used for removing contaminants (followed by soil improvement, waste management, energy production, and climate change mitigation). Various strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis) of biochar production and wide-ranging applicability were identified. Lastly, gaps were identified including the need for performing elaborate life cycle assessments, exploring machine learning and artificial intelligence for upgrading conversion technology and producing application-specific biochar, and investigating mechanistic aspects of soil-biochar interactions and nano-scale transformation of biochar. The study covers a broad spectrum of biochar applicability to identify areas receiving lesser attention, which could guide the future researchers for augmenting biochar research.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 9
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - The influence of biochar-released dissolved organic matter (BDOM) on the transcription of gene (DEG) in Pseudomonas stutzeri and Shewanella putrefacien during sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and chloramphenicol (CAP) biodegradation under visible light was investigated in this study. The results indicated that BDOM components would be nutrients for bacterial amplification and growth under the culture conditions of xenon lamp irradiation and avoiding light, especially BDOM from low temperatures. Additionally, visible light irradiation would improve the saturated fatty acid by stimulating the cell membrane of the microorganism, thus promoting the biodegradation of antibiotics through altering P. stutzeri and S. putrefaciens reoxidative and catabolism processes and significantly inhabiting the copy number of their genes. Moreover, the upregulated genes and enzymes related to SMX and CAP-metabolic and catabolic processes were enriched, which were involved in the pathways of biodegradation, further improving biodegradation efficiency. In particular, interaction network analysis between the top 100 dominant functional genes from P. stutzeri and S. putrefaciens and the molecular types of BDOM, e.g., CHO, CHON, and CHOS (p < 0.05), indicated that the genes of molecular function showed a high positive or negative correlation with the CHO type of BDOM. The results revealed that the CHO type of BDOM affected the functional genes of molecular function, cellular component, and biological process from P. stutzeri and S. putrefaciens, influencing the biodegradation of SMX and CAP. This study provided an basis for BDOM playing a role in antibiotic removal from the aqueous solution using biochar combined with photobiodegradation.

TI  - Adsorption of methane on biochar for emission reduction in oil and gas fields
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 15
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - To contribute to the reduction of methane emissions, using low-cost biochar as adsorbents for capturing and storing methane in oil and gas fields is investigated. This work presents results of methane adsorption on four biochars made from forestry wastes in comparison with the results of three commercial activated carbons. Although the adsorption capacity of the biochars is lower by over 50% than that of the activated carbons, thelow-cost and potential environmental benefits provide the incentive to the investigation. Moreover, it is shown that biochar can store more methane than vessels of compressed gas up to the pressure of 75 bar, suggesting the possibility of avoiding high-pressure gas compression and heavy vessels for cost savings in oil and gas fields. The thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors of the adsorption are studied and implications for the targeted application are discussed.

TI  - A bibliographic study reviewing the last decade of hydrochar in environmental application: history, status quo, and trending research paths
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 12
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) technology has increasingly been considered for biomass conversion applications because of its economic and environmental advantages. As an HTC conversion product, hydrochar has been widely used in the agricultural and environmental fields for decades. A CiteSpace-based system analysis was used for conducting a bibliometric study to understand the state of hydrochar environmental application research from 2011 to 2021. Researchers had a basic understanding of hydrochar between 2011 and 2016 when they discovered hydrochar could apply to agricultural and environmental improvement projects. Keyword clustering results of the literature published in 2017–2021 showed that soil quality and plant growth were the major research topics, followed by carbon capture and greenhouse gas emissions, organic pollutant removal, and heavy metal adsorption and its bioavailability. This review also pointed out the challenge and perspective for hydrochar research and application, namely: (1) the environmental effects of hydrochar on soils need to be clarified in terms of the scope and conditions; (2) the influence of soil microorganisms needs to be investigated to illustrate the impact of hydrochar on greenhouse gas emissions; (3) combined heavy metal and organic contaminant sorption experiments for hydrochar need to be conducted for large-scale applications; (4) more research needs to be conducted to reveal the economic benefits of hydrochar and the coupling of hydrochar with anaerobic digestion technology. This review suggested that it would be valuable to create a database that contains detailed information on how hydrochar got from different sources, and different preparation conditions can be applied in the environmental field.

TI  - Experimental and numerical investigations of biochar-facilitated Cd2+ transport in saturated porous media: role of solution pH and ionic strength
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 10
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - The nanoscale biochar (N-BC) generated during the production and weathering of bulk biochar has caused significant concerns for its cotransport with contaminants spreading the contamination. In this study, the cotransport behaviors of N-BC with Cd2+ under variable solution chemistry were investigated for the first time, which can pose environmental contamination risks but have received little attention. The column experiment results showed that increasing ionic strength (IS) or decreasing pH retarded the transport of N-BC but promoted the transport of Cd2+ in their individual transport. In cotransport scenarios, Cd2+ facilitated the deposition of N-BC on the quartz sand with increasing IS or decreasing pH by providing additional sorption sites and led to the ripening of N-BC via cation bridging. N-BC retarded the transport of Cd2+ under all conditions. However, lower pH and higher IS could facilitate the release of Cd2+ from the immobile N-BC. The cotransport modeling results demonstrated that the Cd2+ adsorption on and desorption from the immobile N-BC controlled the retention and release of Cd2+ under variable pH and IS, while the influence of mobile N-BC on Cd2+ transport was minor. This study provided new insight for evaluating the potential contamination-spreading risks and suggested that rational use of biochar with great caution is necessary.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 26
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - To improve the phosphorus (P) recovery efficiency from livestock wastewater, a novel MgO doped mildewed corn biochar with thermal pre-puffing treatment (Mg-PBC) and without pre-puffing (Mg-BC) was synthesized and tested. The thermal-puffing pretreatment improved the effectiveness of metal soaking and MgO dispersion. P recovery time with Mg-PBC (7 h) was significantly shorter than that with Mg-BC (12 h). Moreover, Mg-PBC showed significantly higher P recovery capacity (241 mg g−1) than Mg-BC (96.6 mg g−1). P recovery capacity of the Mg-PBC fitted to the Thomas model was 90.7 mg g−1, which was 4 times higher than that of Mg-BC (22.9 mg g−1) under column test conditions. The mechanisms involved in P recovery included precipitation, surface complexation, and electrostatic interaction. After adsorption, both Mg-BC and Mg-PBC showed relatively low regeneration abilities. The P loaded Mg-BC (Mg-BC-P) and Mg-PBC (Mg-PBC-P), the later particularly, obviously increased the available P content and promoted plant growth. The release of P increased with time in the Mg-PBC-P treated soil, while it decreased with time in the P fertilizer treated soil. A cost–benefit analysis revealed that thermal-puffing pretreatment greatly increased the profit of MgO doped biochar from −0.66 to 5.90 US$ kg−1. These findings highlight that biomass pre-puffing is a feasible treatment to produce MgO modified biochar and to recover P from livestock wastewater, and that the Mg-PBC-P can be used as a slow-release P fertilizer.

TI  - Insights into the mechanisms underlying the biodegradation of phenanthrene in biochar-amended soil: from bioavailability to soil microbial communities
JO  - Biochar
SP  - 14
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - The dynamic effect of biochar amendment in contaminated soil on the bioavailability of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and microbial communities and how it comprehensively affects PAH biodegradation remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of wheat straw-derived biochars obtained at 300 and 500 °C at different amendment levels (0.03% and 0.3%) on the mineralization kinetics of phenanthrene with different initial concentrations (2 and 20 mg kg−1) in soil by indigenous microorganisms. The results revealed that the addition of biochar inhibited both the rates and extents of mineralization in low-concentration phenanthrene-contaminated soil (PLS) by 38.9–78.3% and 23.9–53.6%, respectively. This was because biochar amendment in the PLS greatly reduced the bioavailable fraction of phenanthrene for degradation owing to its strong sorption and also decreased that to specific degrading bacterial genera, which hindered their growth and reduced their abundances by 1.37–36.6%. However, biochar addition into the soil contaminated with high concentrations of phenanthrene (PHS) resulted in its effective mineralization and enhanced mineralization rates and extents at high amendment levels by 32.4–86.7% and 32.0–44.7%, respectively. This was because biochar amendment in the PHS significantly promoted the abundances of the total bacterial communities (29.9–80.4%) and potential degrading genera (1.89–25.9%) by providing nutrients and stimulated the specific PAH-degradative nidA gene abundance by 1–2 times. These findings will guide the use of biochar to remediate soils with different PAH pollution levels based on the two roles that they play (i.e., immobilizing PAHs or facilitating PAH degradation).

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 22
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - Crystal morphology of metal oxides in engineered metal-biochar composites governs the removal of phosphorus (P) from aqueous solutions. Up to our best knowledge, preparation of bio-assembled MgO-coated biochar and its application for the removal of P from solutions and kitchen waste fermentation liquids have not yet been studied.  Therefore, in this study, a needle-like MgO particle coated tea waste biochar composite (MTC) was prepared through a novel biological assembly and template elimination process. The produced MTC was used as an adsorbent for removing P from a synthetic solution and real kitchen waste fermentation liquid. The maximum P sorption capacities of the MTC, deduced from the Langmuir model, were 58.80 mg g−1 from the solution at pH 7 and 192.8 mg g−1 from the fermentation liquid at pH 9. The increase of ionic strength (0–0.1 mol L−1 NaNO3) reduced P removal efficiency from 98.53% to 93.01% in the synthetic solution but had no significant impact on P removal from the fermentation liquid. Precipitation of MgHPO4 and Mg(H2PO4)2 (76.5%), ligand exchange (18.0%), and electrostatic attraction (5.5%) were the potential mechanisms for P sorption from the synthetic solution, while struvite formation (57.6%) and ligand exchange (42.2%) governed the sorption of P from the kitchen waste fermentation liquid. Compared to previously reported MgO-biochar composites, MTC had a lower P sorption capacity in phosphate solution but a higher P sorption capacity in fermentation liquid. Therefore, the studied MTC could be used as an effective candidate for the removal of P from aqueous environments, and especially from the fermentation liquids. In the future, it will be necessary to systematically compare the performance of metal-biochar composites with different metal oxide crystal morphology for P removal from different types of wastewater.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 17

IS  - 1
AB  - Biochar has various agricultural applications, including the promising use as a carrier for beneficial microorganisms. However, most recent research has demonstrated the possible attachment or immobilization of a single bacterial species onto biochar rather than a consortium of microbes for biotechnological applications. Thus, an assessment on the potential of oil palm kernel shell (OPKS) biochar as a biofilm-producing Bacillus consortium carrier through optimization study on the operating and environmental factors influencing the biofilm adhesion was conducted using response surface methodology (RSM) and the subsequent soil stability and storage potential of the formulation. The highest Bacillus population   was observed  at temperature  33 °C, agitation speed of 135 rpm, at a neutral pH of 7.5 with 10% (w/w) of sago starch as the co-carbon source. The adhesion of Bacillus on OPKS biochar following the optimized conditions fitted pseudo-second order (PSO) of kinetic modelling (R2 = 0.998). The optimized formulation was subjected to storage in different temperatures and in vitro soil incubation which revealed that the Bacillus biofilm-adhered OPKS biochar may be stored up to 4 months with minimum range of live Bacillus viability reaching 107 CFU g-1 of biochar which is within the minimum range of acceptable biofertilizer viability (106 CFU mL-1). Formulation that is viable in room storage can be easily incorporated into current agricultural distribution networks that do not have refrigeration. This work highlighted the physicochemical and soil stability qualities of optimized Bacillus consortium adhesion on biochar for agricultural usage.

AB  - Excess phosphorus (P) in water can lead to eutrophication and upset ecological balance. In this study, biochar with ultrathin two-dimensional nanosheets from the natural mesocarp of shaddock was chosen as the carrier. The highly dispersed and small particle size of La(OH)3 on the surface of the nanosheets (MSBL3) was successfully achieved using chemical impregnation for the adsorption of P in aqueous solution, and the maximum adsorption capacity was 260.0 mg P g−1 [La]. The differences in surface crystallization of La(OH)3 on biochar at different La loadings were analyzed using the high-precision characterization methods. After six adsorption–desorption cycles, MSBL3 retained 76.7% of its initial performance in terms of the P adsorption capacity. The preparation of 1 g of MSBL3 costs about RMB 1, and it could reduce the P concentration in 2.6 ton of Laoyu River water to below the eutrophication threshold; and the inhibitory effect of MSBL3 on the eutrophication of water bodies was confirmed by the growth state of water hyacinth. Furthermore, 0.1 M MSBL3 could inhibit Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus up to 98.7% and 85.0%, respectively, which indicates that MSBL3 can be used to recover P from water and also to improve water quality. In addition, the growth of the maize seedlings verified that the P-absorbed MSBL3 waste is a good soil fertilizer and can solve the problem of post-treatment of the adsorbent. In conclusion, MSBL3 prepared in this study is a promising P sorbent for application.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 18
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - Torrefaction operation is an essential pathway for solid biofuel upgrading, and good hydrophobicity of torrefied biochar is conducive to its storage. Herein, a two-stage treatment of torrefaction followed by modification by hexadecyltrimethoxysilane was adopted to improve the moisture resistance performance of biochar. This two-stage treatment process led to a longer torrefied microalgal biochar preservation time (60–200% improved) and great superhydrophobicity and superlipophilicity. Therefore, the modified microalgal biochar could significantly adsorb leaking oil for environmental remediation and further improve the calorific value of the biochar. The obtained results indicated that the oil adsorption capacity of modified microalgal biochar was correlated to torrefaction temperature and oil species. Specifically, the oil adsorption capacity was enhanced up to 70–80% from the modification process when comparing to raw microalga. Increasing the torrefaction temperature enhanced the adsorption quantity of the modified microalgal biochar. By adsorbing the oil, the calorific value of oilchar, namely, biochar with adsorbed oil, could be higher than 40 MJ kg− 1. Furthermore, the pyrolysis and combustion characteristics suggested that biochar stability gradually rose as the torrefaction temperature increased. By comprehensively analyzing and comparing the fuel performance of the modified microalgal biochar with previous literature, the obtained modified microalgal biochar possessed better fuel properties and environmental sustainability.

JO  - Biochar

VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - The single high-dose application of biochar to increase rice yield has been well reported. However, limited information is available about the long-term effects of increasing rice yield and soil fertility. This study was designed to perform a 6-year field experiment to unveil the rice yield with time due to various biochar application strategies. Moreover, an alternative strategy of the Annual Low dose biochar application (AL, 8 × 35% = 2.8 t ha−1) was also conducted to make a comparison with the High Single dose (HS, 22.5 t ha−1), and annual Rice Straw (RS, 8 t ha−1) amendment to investigate the effects on annual rice yield attributes and soil nutrient concentrations. Results showed that the rice yield in AL with a lower biochar application exceeded  that of HS significantly (p < 0.05) in the 6th experimental year. The rice yield increased by 14.3% in RS, 10.9% in AL, and 4.2% in HS. The unexpectedly higher rice yield in AL than HS resulted from enhanced soil total carbon (TC), pH, and available Ca. However, compared to AL, liable carbon fraction increased by 33.7% in HS, while refractory carbon fraction dropped by 22.3%. Likewise, biochar characterization showed that more oxygen functional groups existed in HS than in AL. Decreasing inert organic carbon pools due to the constant degradation of the aromatic part of biochar in HS led to a lower soil TC than AL, even with a higher amount of biochar application. Likewise, the annual depletion lowered the soil pH and available Ca declination in HS. Based on the obtained results, this study suggested AL as a promising strategy to enhance rice productivity, soil nutrient enrichment, and carbon sequestration in the paddy ecosystem.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 21
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - The literature has shown that biochar can serve as potential amendment to achieve sustainable agriculture and environment. The accessibility and availability of cheap feedstock are considered as important constraint factors for the widespread application of biochar in agriculture. Marginal lands are widely distributed globally, several times larger than arable land, and hold little value for food production due to poor soil conditions. However, these lands are suitable for growing plants, which can be used as feedstock for biochar production. The salt-affected lands, as one of the main marginal lands, are particularly suitable for cultivating diverse varieties of halophytes that can be pyrolyzed into biochar, bio-gas, and bio-oil. The halophyte-derived biochar is useful to produce a desirable acid soil conditioner due to its high ash and rich bases, and improves soil characteristics under extreme saline conditions. Additionally, syngas and bio-oil hold potential benefits as fuels and industrial raw materials. This study introduces an innovative management technique for marginal lands such as salt-affected land, which can provide all-round benefits in food production, land management, vegetation coverage, carbon sequestration, and climate change mitigation.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 19
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - This work demonstrated that Enteromorpha biochar with introduced iron (SFB900-3) could activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) efficiently for NTP remediation. It removed 83.9%–95.1% of NTP in 60 min under a wide pH range from 3.15 to 8.95. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed the synergistic relationship between internal Fe single atoms and introduced Fe compounds—Fe3C. The adsorption capacity of SFB900-3 for persulfate improved from −0.953 eV to −4.214 eV, and the Bader charge analysis showed that Fe atoms as active sites (0.658 e) enhanced the adsorption capacity more than carbon (0.050 e). Moreover, the energy barrier for PMS dissociation reduced from 0.072 eV to −5.372  eV due to the longer length of O–O bond under the synergistic effect of Fe single atom and Fe3C which increased from 1.467 Å to 3.890 Å. The quenching experiment confirmed that 1O2 was the main active substance in NTP degradation and its contribution rate was 88.2%, which was further verified by EPR detection. The effect factor experiments proved that the SFB900-3/PMS system had stable and efficient activity for NTP removal, which remained at 73.6% removal rate after three rounds of tests. This work provided novel guidance for constructing efficient and stable biochar-based materials for organic pollutant remediation.

JO  - Biochar
SP  - 20
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - Microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) technique utilizes ureolytic bacteria to decompose urea and generate carbonate ions for metal combination. MICP can remediate heavy metal (e.g., Cd) contaminated soils while maintaining or even improving soil functions, but its efficiency in agricultural soil practical application still needs to be enhanced. Here, we constructed a biochar-bacteria (2B) partnership in which biochar provides high nutrition and diverse sorption sites. Using the 2B system, Cd immobilization effectiveness and the underlying mechanism were examined along with the soil properties and soil functions. Results showed that compared to the single biochar and ureolytic bacteria systems, soil Cd mobility was reduced by 23.6% and 45.8% through co-precipitating with CaCO3 as otavite (CdCO3) in the 2B system, whereas soil fertility, bacterial diversity, and richness increased by 11.7–90.2%, 5.4–16.1%, and 6.8–54.7%, respectively. Moreover, the abundances of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were enhanced in the 2B system. Notably, Sporosarcina and Bacillus (Firmicutes genus) that carry the ureC gene were boosted in the system, further implicating the microbiological mechanism in reducing Cd migration and its bioavailability in soil. Overall, the constructed 2B system was efficient in soil Cd immobilization by strengthening the ureolytic bacteria growth and their nutrient supply in the bacteria-rich soil ecosystem.

AB  - Metal-free porous biochars are popularly utilized as catalysts for peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation. The enhancement effect of PDS activation of porous biochars fabricated by employing both hard template and alkali metal activating agent has not been explored completely. In addition, the role of the inherent carbon defect in PDS activation has not been clearly elucidated. Hence, a series of carbonaceous catalysts were fabricated using a sole template (KCl), a sole activating agent (Na2S2O3) or a combination of template and activating agent (KCl/Na2S2O3, KCl/KHCO3, KCl/NaHCO3, and KCl/Na2C2O4), to systematically investigate the effect of specific surface area (SSA) and intrinsic defect of porous biochar on its PDS activation ability. The biochar synthesized by KCl and Na2S2O3 (SK-C) exhibited the optimum degradation performance. The SK-C was found to possess an interconnected hollow cage with three-dimensional mesh structure showing the largest surface area, pore volume and C-sp3 edge  defect content among all the catalysts, which explained its paramount catalytic ability. The SSA and C-sp3 content together can determine the catalytic performance in a quantitative relationship. The single electron transfer pathway from SDZ to inner-sphere bound SK-C/PDS* was the protagonist of pollutant oxidation. The degradation intermediates were detected and recognized and their toxicities were evaluated. This study for the first time comprehensively identified the synergistic effect between the SSA and inherent defects on improving the catalytic performance of biochar for PDS activation to removal contaminants.

AB  - Paddy fields are a major emission source of greenhouse gases (GHGs) [for instance, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2)] among agricultural fields. Biochar has been deemed a potential candidate for the reduction of GHGs in paddy fields. However, there is no consistent conclusion that biochar can simultaneously reduce emissions of CH4, N2O, and CO2. Herein, we proposed the FeN3-doped biochar (FG) as an excellent material for GHGs restriction in paddy fields via the first-principles calculation. The computation results indicated that the FG exhibited satisfactory adsorption ability for CH4, CO2, and N2O, which improved the adsorption energies to −1.37 , −1.54, and −2.91 eV, respectively. Moreover, the density of state (DOS) analyses revealed that the factor responsible for FeN3-doped biochar to exhibit excellent adsorption ability was the occurrence of drastic energy up- or down-shift of the electron for Fe d, C p, O p, or N p orbital upon adsorption of CH4, CO2, or N2O. Our study suggested an advanced modified biochar material for reducing the GHGs emissions in paddy fields, in addition to exploring the adsorption properties and mechanisms of FeN3-doped biochar for GHGs mitigation, which provided a strategy to explore biochar modification and efficient emission reduction materials.

AB  - Due to large specific surface area, abundant functional groups and low cost, biochar is widely used for pollutant removal. The adsorption performance of biochar is related to biochar synthesis and adsorption parameters. But the influence factor is numerous, the traditional experimental enumeration is powerless. In recent years, machine learning has been gradually employed for biochar, but there is no comprehensive review on the whole process regulation of biochar adsorbents, covering synthesis optimization and adsorption modeling. This review article systematically summarized the application of machine learning in biochar adsorbents from the perspective of all-round regulation for the first time, including the synthesis optimization and adsorption modeling of biochar adsorbents. Firstly, the overview of machine learning was introduced. Then, the latest advances of machine learning in biochar synthesis for pollutant removal were summarized, including prediction of biochar yield and physicochemical properties, optimal synthetic conditions and economic cost. And the application of machine learning in pollutant adsorption by biochar was reviewed, covering prediction of adsorption efficiency, optimization of experimental conditions and revelation of adsorption mechanism. General guidelines for the application of machine learning in whole-process optimization of biochar from synthesis to adsorption were presented. Finally, the existing problems and future perspectives of machine learning for biochar adsorbents were put forward. We hope that this review can promote the integration of machine learning and biochar, and thus light up the industrialization of biochar.

TI  - Biochar application significantly increases soil organic carbon under conservation tillage: an 11-year field experiment

AB  - Biochar application and conservation tillage are significant for long-term organic carbon (OC) sequestration in soil and enhancing crop yields, however, their effects on native soil organic carbon (native SOC) without biochar carbon sequestration in situ remain largely unknown. Here, an 11-year field experiment was carried out to examine different biochar application rates (0, 30, 60, and 90 Mg ha−1) on native SOC pools (native labile SOC pool I and II, and native recalcitrant SOC) and microbial activities in calcareous soil across an entire winter wheat–maize rotation. The proportions of C3 and C4-derived native SOC mineralization were quantified using soil basal respiration (SBR) combined with 13C natural isotope abundance measurements. The results showed that 39–51% of the biochar remained in the top 30 cm after 11 years. Biochar application rates significantly increased native SOC and native recalcitrant SOC contents but decreased the proportion of native labile SOC [native labile SOC pool I and II, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC)]. Biochar application tended to increase the indicators of microbial activities associated with SOC degradation, such as SBR, fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis activity, and metabolic quotient (qCO2). Meanwhile, higher biochar application rates (B60 and B90) significantly increased the C4-derived CO2 proportion of the SBR and enhanced C4-derived native SOC mineralization. The effect of the biochar application rate on the content and proportion of native SOC fractions occurred in the 0–15 cm layer, however, there were no significant differences at 15–30 cm. Soil depth also significantly increased native labile SOC pool I and II contents and decreased qCO2. In conclusion, the biochar application rate significantly increased native SOC accumulation in calcareous soil by enhancing the proportion of native recalcitrant SOC, and biochar application and soil depth collectively influenced the seasonal turnover of native SOC fractions, which has important implications for long-term agricultural soil organic carbon sequestration.

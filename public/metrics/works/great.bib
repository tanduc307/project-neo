abstract = {Biochar can be an effective carrier for microbial inoculants because of its favourable properties promoting microbial life. In this review, we assess the effectiveness of biochar as a microbial carrier for agricultural and environmental applications. Biochar is enriched with organic carbon, contains nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium as nutrients, and has a high porosity and moisture-holding capacity. The large number of active hydroxyl, carboxyl, sulfonic acid group, amino, imino, and acylamino hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups are effective for microbial cell adhesion and proliferation. The use of biochar as a carrier of microbial inoculum has been shown to enhance the persistence, survival and colonization of inoculated microbes in soil and plant roots, which play a crucial role in soil biochemical processes, nutrient and carbon cycling, and soil contamination remediation. Moreover, biochar-based microbial inoculants including probiotics effectively promote plant growth and remediate soil contaminated with organic pollutants. These findings suggest that biochar can serve as a promising substitute for non-renewable substrates, such as peat, to formulate and deliver microbial inoculants. The future research directions in relation to improving the carrier material performance and expanding the potential applications of this emerging biochar-based microbial immobilization technology have been proposed.}

abstract = {Biochar, a carbonaceous material with engineering potential, has gained attention as an efficient catalyst in persulfate-based advanced oxidation processes (PS-AOPs). Although biomass feedstocks are known as a critical factor for the performance of biochar, the relationship between the catalytic efficiency/mechanism and the types of biomass feedstocks is still unclear. Thus, according to recent advances in experimental and theoretical researches, this paper provides a systematic review of the properties of biochar, and the relationship between catalytic performance in PS-AOPs and biomass feedstocks, where the differences in physicochemical properties (surface properties, pore structure, etc.) and activation path of different sourced biochars, are introduced. In addition, how the tailoring of biochar (such as heteroatomic doping and co-pyrolysis of biomass) affects its activation efficiency and mechanism in PS-AOPs is summarized. Finally, the suitable application scenarios or systems of different sourced biochars, appropriate methods to improve the catalytic performance of different types of biochar and the prospects and challenges for the development of biochar in PS-AOPs are proposed.}

abstract = {Environmental issues caused by food waste are important concerns for human well-being and ecosystem health. Valorization of food waste into energy and carbon materials has been extensively investigated. Here, we reviewed the most recent advancements in the thermochemical conversion of food waste into engineered biochar. Synthesis routes and practical applications of the food waste-derived biochar was succinctly reviewed. Engineered biochar is a promising alternative for mitigating environmental pollution and alleviating energy crisis. The underlying relationships between engineered biochar properties and specific applications are still unclear, therefore, machine learning-aided engineered biochar design and process optimization was proposed. Moreover, before any industrial scale implementation, detailed assessments of the environmental benefits and economic feasibility must be conducted. In the context of carbon neutrality, thermochemical upcycling of food waste into engineered biochar for energy and environmental applications can significantly contribute to attaining sustainable food waste management, mitigating environmental pollution, and addressing the energy shortage crisis, and thus will eventually facilitate the fulfillment of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Furthermore, the existing challenges in the practical valorization of food waste into engineered biochar are comprehensively discussed, and outlooks are proposed.}

abstract = {The replacement of inert gas by CO2 in pyrolysis has piqued a great deal of interest in recent years due to its numerous positive effects on end products. The reactive nature of CO2 at higher pyrolysis temperatures (above 700 °C) during pyrolysis improves pyrolytic gas production (H2, CO, and CH4) by increasing thermal cracking of tar, inhibiting secondary char formation, and enhancing char gasification, thereby reducing char yield. The existing review articles focus on the impact of CO2 on tar and gaseous products during pyrolysis, with little information on its impact on biochar production and properties via slow pyrolysis of various organic wastes. Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate the effect of CO2 on biochar production during slow pyrolysis for industrial purposes, because CO2 from flue gas can be used as the pyrolysis gas environment, which can ultimately improve biochar production in terms of economic viability, environmental impact, and modified properties. The goal of this review is to conduct a thorough investigation of the effect of CO2 atmosphere on slow pyrolysis performance (400–700 °C), with a particular emphasis on biochar yield and properties for environmental and agricultural applications in comparison to inert atmosphere by highlighting the existing challenges and future opportunities.}

The results showed that the duration of the thermophilic stage, the degradation of organic matter and the detoxification of the compost were enhanced in the BC, MI and BCMI treatments compared with those in the control (without additive). Moreover, the content of total Kjeldahl nitrogen in the BC, MI and BCMI treatments was increased by 38.1, 48.9 and 59.0%, respectively, through the reduction of NH3 volatilization and N2O production, which were higher than those of the control (31.8%). A reduction in CH4 release during composting was not observed with the MI and BCMI treatments. Following 42 days of composting, the final product of the three treatments exhibited acceptable potential for use as a fertilizer in agriculture; the BCMI treatment showed an especially synergistic effect on pig manure composting enhancement.},

abstract = {Biochars have the potential to reclaim mine-impacted soils; however, their variable physico-chemical properties incite speculation about their successful remediation performance. This investigation examined the capability of biochars produced from three different feedstocks along with a compost blend to improve switchgrass growth conditions in a mine-impacted soil by examining influences on soil pH, grass metal contents, and soil-extractable metal concentrations. Cadmium (Cd)- and zinc (Zn)-contaminated mine soil was collected from a site near Webb City, Missouri, USA--a location within the Tri-State Mining District. In a full factorial design, soil was treated with a 0%, 2.5%, and 5% (w/w) compost mixture (wood chips + beef cattle manure), and 0%, 2.5% and 5% of each biochar pyrolyzed from beef cattle manure, poultry litter, and lodgepole pine feedstocks. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum, ‘Cave-In-Rock’ variety) was grown in a greenhouse for 50 days and the mass of shoots (above-ground biomass) and roots was assessed, while soil pH, deionized H2O- and 0.01 M CaCl2-extractable Cd and Zn concentrations were measured. Poultry litter biochar and compost had the greatest ability to raise soil pH (from 4.40 to 6.61), beef cattle manure biochar and compost moderately raised pH (from 4.4 to 5.92), and lodgepole pine biochar and compost weakly raised pH (from 4.40 to 5.05). Soils treated with beef cattle manure biochar, poultry litter biochar significantly reduced deionized H2O- and 0.01 M CaCl2-extractable Cd and Zn concentrations, while lodgepole pine biochar-treated soils showed mixed results. Switchgrass shoot and root masses were greatest in soil treated with compost in combination with either beef cattle manure biochar or poultry litter biochar. Soils treated with 5% beef cattle manure biochar + 5% compost had greater reductions in total Cd and Zn concentrations measured in switchgrass shoots and roots compared to the other two treatments. The three biochars and compost mixtures applied to heavy metal, mine-impacted soil had considerable performance dissimilarities for improving switchgrass productivity. Switchgrass growth was noticeably improved after treatment with the compost in combination with biochar from beef cattle manure or poultry litter. This may be explained by the increased soil pH that promoted Zn and Cd precipitation and organic functional groups that reduced soil-available heavy metal concentrations. Our results imply that creating designer biochars is an important management component in developing successful mine-site phytostabilization programs.},

abstract = {Dairy pastures can be a major source of soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions due to the combination of intensive nitrogen (N) fertiliser use and high soil water content, from either rainfall and/or irrigation. Biochar application is a promising approach to lower soil greenhouse gas emissions, particularly under high soil moisture conditions where denitrification is the primary N-transformation pathway. In a replicated field trial, we evaluated the effects of two contrasting biochars derived from poultry litter and from hardwood on soil N2O emissions, soil ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3−) status, pasture productivity and herbage nutrient content. A liming treatment to mimic the liming equivalence of the poultry litter biochar was used to separate any effects observed from changes in soil pH. To further separate the effects of biochars on soil N status, N2O emissions and pasture N uptake, high and low N fertiliser doses (annual application of 672 kg N ha−1, 336 kg N ha−1) were superimposed across all of the treatments. The N fertiliser dose had no significant impact on pasture yield. Application of poultry litter biochar resulted in significant increases in pasture productivity under both high and low N inputs. This was achieved by alleviating soil P, and possibly K nutritional constraints that are typical in Australian Ferralsols. Under the high N fertiliser dose, emissions of N2O from the treatments and control were not significantly different (p > 0.05) and ranged between 1.14 and 1.78 kg N2O-N ha−1 across the 11-month study. The low N dose resulted in significantly lower emissions of N2O of between 0.80 and 0.84 kg N2O-N ha−1, but biochar had no significant effect on net emissions across the season. The lack of impact of biochar on N2O emissions was attributed to the relatively dry conditions over the trial period resulting in nitrification being the most likely N-transformation pathway. During brief episodes of high soil moisture, peak emissions from the biochar plots were lower than from the control or lime treatment, but these differences did not impact on the emission budget over the 11-month sampling campaign.},
